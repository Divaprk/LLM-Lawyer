With this location flexibility, remote employees may work from their home offices, in cafes, co-working spaces, or even in a different country altogether.\nRemote working therefore forms part of Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) which have taken centre stage in today’s society due to the gig economy and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor employers who wish to hire remote employees (located in Singapore as well as foreign countries), here are several things you might want to consider. This article will cover:\nWhy Might Employers Wish to Consider Hiring Remote Employees?\nSome benefits of hiring remote employees include:\nAttraction and retention of employees:\nOffering FWAs such as remote working might make you a more attractive employer as there may be employees who prefer working from home.\nGreater work-life balance and increased productivity for employees:\nYour employees may be able to enjoy a better\nwork-life balance\n. The decrease in commute time means that employees will be able to have more time to rest and recharge, increasing work productivity. Those with young children or elderly parents will be able to better perform their family responsibilities because they can be at home more often. For some employees, eliminating office distractions, such as colleagues talking to each other, may also increase work performance.\nTackle issues related to manpower crunch:\nYou will have access to a larger manpower base and talent pool. This is because you may have the option of employing those who are unable to commit to office-based work due to family responsibilities or other reasons.\nBetter preparedness for emergency situations with greater ease\n:  Implementing FWAs will allow your company to quickly commence business continuity plans during times of crisis. For example, where your employees cannot work from the office because it has been destroyed by a fire. This way, your company will already have the infrastructure and experience required to efficiently execute remote working.\nNeed not invest in a physical office space:\nNot only does this help you save on the capital costs of setting up a business, it also reduces the amount of money spent on overhead costs such as electricity, water and rent.\nProcess of Hiring Remote Employees\nThe hiring process for remote employees is largely similar to that of non-remote employees.\nOrganisations might have their own preferred hiring processes, thus the process of candidate screening, conducting interviews and so on remains at the discretion of each organisation.\nHowever, it may be advisable to conduct background checks on remote employees, due to the lower levels of physical supervision over them. It may be wise for organisations to ask questions that provide insight into the candidate’s work ethic and potential workspaces.\nRemote employees need employment contracts too. What is an employment contract and what should it include?\nAn\nemployment contract\n, also known as contract of service, defines the employer-employee relationship.\nAccording to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), an employment contract governed by Singapore law must include certain\nKey Employment Terms (KETs)\n. These include the employee’s job title, main duties and responsibilities, basic salary, daily working hours, leaves and bonuses.\nTo minimise disputes on the agreed terms and conditions, MOM recommends that the contract be in writing.\nWhat should be the governing laws of the employment contract?\nThe governing laws of a contract state which country’s laws are to apply to it. Understanding the governing law of a contract is important because the laws of different countries may lead to different legal outcomes with respect to the same contractual terms.\nA contract to be performed in Singapore should ideally designate Singapore law as its governing law, with the Singapore courts as the court of choice.\nWhere the employee is working outside of Singapore, the governing law of the contract would depend on a mutual agreement between the employer and the employee as to which country’s laws should govern the contract. This could be the Employment Act (if Singapore law is adopted) or the overseas country’s employment regulation.\nIn the event of a dispute as to what the governing law of the contract is, it will be for both parties to present their case on which country’s laws should apply to the contract and why.\nHowever, employers of overseas employees might want to keep in mind that even if Singapore law is to govern the employment contract, the terms of the contract should not infringe the local laws of the country that the employee is working in.\nFor example, employees in Singapore are generally not allowed to work for more than 12 hours a day. However, employees in Brunei are not allowed to work for more than 8 hours a day. Therefore if you are hiring an employee in Brunei to work for your Singapore company, you may not require the employee to work for more than 8 hours a day. This is even though Singapore law allows employees to work for up to 12 hours a day.\nDo foreign remote employees need to apply for a work pass?\nRemote employees do not need to apply for a work pass to work for Singapore companies if they are not physically based in Singapore.\nHowever, if the foreign employees will be stationed in Singapore, then they will need to have a valid work pass.\nTripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs)\nIn recognition of the benefits that FWAs such as remote working bring to both employees and employers, and their role in creating a supportive and conducive work environment, the\nTripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements\nwas launched in 2017.\nThis Tripartite Standard on FWAs will ensure that employees are better able to benefit from FWAs, while addressing their concerns. For example, the Tripartite Standard requires employers to inform employees on the availability of FWAs, the company’s\nFWA policy\nand how they can apply for them.\nAdoption of this Tripartite Standard is optional, but doing so may increase the attractiveness of the employer to job applicants. Employers who wish to adopt the Tripartite Standard on Flexible Working Arrangements may refer to\nthis page\nfor more information.\nTripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests (TG-FWAR)\nSingapore has introduced a new Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests (TG-FWAR). It is intended to shape the right norms and expectations around requesting FWAs, such as flexi-place requests, in Singapore.\nUnder the TG-FWAR, all employees who have successfully completed their probation are entitled to submit an FWA request. While the TG-FWAR does not require employers to offer FWAs to employees, employers are required to consider such requests in a reasonable manner.\nThe TG-FWAR took effect on 1 December 2024.\nFor more information, you may refer to our article on\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Guidelines on Flexi-Work Requests\n.\nConsiderations for Organisations that Wish to Hire Remote Employees\nOrganisations may wish to think about whether they will be providing remote employees with necessary equipment such as laptops or mobile phones.\nInvesting in remote desktop sharing software might be useful in resolving technical difficulties faced by remote employees in a timely manner.\nClear communication and regular check-ins with your remote employees are also important in ensuring they are on track in terms of their work progress.\n—\nWith the popularity of FWAs such as remote working, employers stand to benefit from hiring remote employees.\nGiven the importance of the employment contract in defining employer-employee relations, employers may consider\nengaging a lawyer\nto assist with the drafting of the employment contract and ensuring the inclusion of all necessary terms, in accordance with the intended governing law of the contract.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

{"chunk_id": "SLA_b3c1e0cc", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "Letter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Hiring Employees > Letter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply", "text": "Letter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nLast updated on September 25, 2024\nThere are various ways that a potential foreign employee may be allowed to legally work for a Singapore company. One of these ways is through the application of a Letter of Consent by an employer.\nIf you are an employer in Singapore who wants to know how to apply for a Letter of Consent for the hiring of foreign employees, read on.\nThis article will cover:\nWhat is a Letter of Consent?\nA Letter of Consent (LOC) is an authorisation certificate issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) that allows the following pass holders to work in Singapore:\nHolder of Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP or LTVP+) who is married to a Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident, where the pass is valid for at least 3 months from date of application of the Letter of Consent; and\nHolder of LTVP and is the unmarried child (under the age of 21) of a Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident where the pass will be valid for at least 3 months from date of application of the Letter of Consent.\nIf a Dependant’s Pass holder wants to run a business in Singapore, then they will have to apply under the\nseparate Letter of Consent scheme for Dependant’s Pass holders\nwho want to run businesses in Singapore.\nOn the other hand, if a Dependant’s Pass holder or a dependant of an S Pass holder wants to work in Singapore as an employee, they will need to secure a work permit, S Pass or Employment Pass instead.\nThe potential foreign employee seeking to be employed under a Letter of Consent must NOT be holding a directorial role or be a shareholder in the employer company. Letter of Consent holders are also not allowed to work in objectionable occupations such as being a bar/dance hostess or masseur.\nIn order to validly work under a Letter of Consent, the potential foreign employee must have already secured a job offer from a Singapore employer since it is actually the employer that applies for the Letter of Consent (as will be discussed further in a later part of this article).\nHowever, if a foreigner wants to be able to work in Singapore even prior to securing a job offer, then a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent (PLOC) may be a viable option instead.\nWhat is a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nThe Pre-Approved Letter of Consent allows foreign spouses or unmarried children (below 21 years of age) of a Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident (who are eligible for an LTVP or LTVP+) to secure jobs faster and switch employment more conveniently. This is because the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent may be applied for without securing a job offer beforehand, as mentioned above.\nThe Pre-Approved Letter of Consent is tied to an individual and not to a specific employer or employment, as opposed to the Letter of Consent which is only valid for the duration of the employment. Therefore, the holder of the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent need not renew or reapply for a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent upon any change of employment.\nSimilar to Letter of Consent holders, there are also\na list of restricted occupations for Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders\n(which is much more exhaustive) such as, but not limited to:\nJournalist;\nArt critic;\nMedia producer/editor; and\nReligion-related occupations.\nWho Can Apply for a Letter of Consent or a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nThe employer or an appointed employment agent can apply for the Letter of Consent. The Letter of Consent will be sent to the employer, and the foreign employee can begin work only when the employer has received the Letter of Consent. It must be noted that only Singapore employers can apply for a Letter of Consent.\nOn the other hand, PLOCs are applied for by eligible foreigners. They will be given the option to apply for a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent when applying for or renewing their LTVP/LTVP+, for no additional fee.\nHow Does the Employer Apply for a Letter of Consent for their Potential Foreign Employee?\nAn application can be submitted online via the Ministry of Manpower’s\nEmployment Pass (EP) eService\n. Before applying for the Letter of Consent however, the employer needs to obtain the potential foreign employee’s written consent to be gainfully employed by that employer.\nThere is no particular format for the fulfilment of this requirement, and the MOM will accept any document that clearly shows a foreign employee’s acceptance of the employer’s job offer. An example of this written consent may be a signed\ncontract of employment\n.\nFor some professions or occupations, additional documents must be submitted when applying for the Letter of Consent. These occupations include:\nRegional representatives of overseas companies\nHealthcare professionals\nLawyers\nFootball players or coaches\nEmployees in food establishments\nFor a detailed list of the additional required documents, please check the\nMinistry of Manpower’s website here\n.\nIf the additional required documents are not in English, then both the original documents, as well as an English translation, must be submitted. The MOM also reserves the right to ask for any other necessary documents while reviewing the Letter of Consent application.\nOnce the letter is approved, the Letter of Consent may be obtained and printed from the EP eService.\nSimilar to the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent, there is no application fee for Letter of Consent applications.\nHow Long Will It Take to Get a Letter of Consent?\nLetter of Consent applications may take 1 week for most cases.\nEmployers may check the application status in the EP eService after 1 week from submission of application. If more information is required, the application may take longer to process.\nWhat is the Duration for the Validity of the Letter of Consent and the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nThe Letter of Consent is valid for the duration indicated by the employer in the Letter of Consent application or until the expiry of the employee’s LTVP or LTVP+, whichever occurs earlier.\nAccordingly, the Letter of Consent stops being valid in the following instances:\nOnce the LTVP or LTVP+ is cancelled;\nOnce the LTVP or LTVP+ expires; or\nIf the foreign employee is no longer employed by the employer that applied for their Letter of Consent. In this instance, however, the employer still needs to cancel the Letter of Consent.\nFor Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders, the duration of the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent will be the same as that of their LTVP/LTVP+. Hence similar to the above, once the LTVP/LTVP+ expires or is cancelled, the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent ceases to be valid.\nIs there a Minimum Salary Requirement to Obtain a Letter of Consent or a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nNo, there is no minimum salary requirement for Letter of Consent and Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders.\nNo foreign worker levy or quota is also required when an employer wishes to hire Letter of Consent or Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders.\nWhat Conditions Must Foreign Employees Abide by to Validly Work Under a Letter of Consent or a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nFor employees under a Letter of Consent\nPer the\nEmployment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations\n, the foreign employee must:\nEngage only in the trade, profession or occupation specified in the Letter of Consent; and\nObtain prior consent from the MOM before engaging in any trade, profession or occupation not specified in the Letter of Consent.\nFurthermore, the foreign employee must inform the MOM, within 7 days, of the:\nTermination or completion (without renewal) of the employment that is the subject of the Letter of Consent; or\nCancellation or expiry (without renewal) of their LTVP or LTVP+.\nFor employees under a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent\nPre-Approved Letter of Consent holders who take up employment in Singapore must show their employer the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent that was issued alongside their valid LTVP/LTVP+.\nOther legal requirements specific to practice of certain professions, such as registration requirements, must also be complied with.\nWhat is the Obligation of an Employer That Wishes to Hire a Potential Employee Holding a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nEmployers of Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders are required to\nnotify MOM\nof the employment before the employee starts work. They also have to notify the MOM of any termination of employment within 7 days from the employee’s last day of work.\nWhat are the Factors That May Affect the Outcome of an Application for a Letter of Consent?\nEach application is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the outcome of the application is entirely at the discretion of the MOM. The following are some factors that can affect the successful grant of a Letter of Consent:\nThe potential employee’s age, salary, citizenship, qualifications (including education, work experience and skills).\nThe potential employee’s overall job profile.\nThe economic viability of the Singapore company applying for the Letter of Consent on behalf of the potential employee.\nThe availability of local candidates for the position being offered to the foreign potential employee. For example, the outcome for the successful grant of the Letter of Consent increases if the job or position being filled by the employee is in a field where local candidates (i.e. Singapore citizens or permanent residents) are not readily available.\nHow Can a Letter of Consent be Cancelled?\nThe employer or an appointed employment agent may apply for the cancellation of the Letter of Consent within 1 week after the foreign employee’s last day of the notice period for the termination of employment.\nBefore cancellation, however, the following need to be accomplished:\nA tax clearance must first be sought from the\nInland Revenue Authority of Singapore\n; and\nAll outstanding employment issues, including full payment of salaries, should first be settled.\nCancellation can be done via the EP eService and takes immediate effect.\nWhat Should be Done If a Letter of Consent is Lost?\nIn instances when the Letter of Consent is lost or misplaced, the loss must be reported to the MOM and a replacement should be requested through\nhere\n.\nCan the Letter of Consent be Renewed and If So, How?\nThe employer or an appointed employment agent may apply for the renewal of the Letter of Consent in order to continue the valid and lawful employment of the foreign employee.\nFor LTVP/LTVP+ holders, application for renewal can be done up to 6 months before the Letter of Consent expires. However, the LTVP/LTVP+ must be valid for at least 3 months in order for the Letter of Consent to be renewed. If it is not, the foreign employee must first renew the LTVP/LTVP+.\nSimilar to the application for cancellation of Letter of Consent, renewal can be done via the EP eService. There is no application fee required for renewal of a Letter of Consent.\n—\nIf you are a Singapore employer intending to hire a LTVP/LTVP+ holder via a Letter of Consent, do note that the validity of a Letter of Consent or a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent is directly tied to the immigration status of your potential foreign employee.\nHence if you require any assistance to ensure a smooth hiring process,\nengaging a corporate services firm\nmay be beneficial not just for the application of the Letter of Consent, but also to provide assistance to your potential employee’s application for a (or renewal of their existing) LTVP or LTVP+.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

One of these ways is through the application of a Letter of Consent by an employer.\nIf you are an employer in Singapore who wants to know how to apply for a Letter of Consent for the hiring of foreign employees, read on.\nThis article will cover:\nWhat is a Letter of Consent?\nA Letter of Consent (LOC) is an authorisation certificate issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) that allows the following pass holders to work in Singapore:\nHolder of Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP or LTVP+) who is married to a Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident, where the pass is valid for at least 3 months from date of application of the Letter of Consent; and\nHolder of LTVP and is the unmarried child (under the age of 21) of a Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident where the pass will be valid for at least 3 months from date of application of the Letter of Consent.\nIf a Dependant’s Pass holder wants to run a business in Singapore, then they will have to apply under the\nseparate Letter of Consent scheme for Dependant’s Pass holders\nwho want to run businesses in Singapore.\nOn the other hand, if a Dependant’s Pass holder or a dependant of an S Pass holder wants to work in Singapore as an employee, they will need to secure a work permit, S Pass or Employment Pass instead.\nThe potential foreign employee seeking to be employed under a Letter of Consent must NOT be holding a directorial role or be a shareholder in the employer company. Letter of Consent holders are also not allowed to work in objectionable occupations such as being a bar/dance hostess or masseur.\nIn order to validly work under a Letter of Consent, the potential foreign employee must have already secured a job offer from a Singapore employer since it is actually the employer that applies for the Letter of Consent (as will be discussed further in a later part of this article).\nHowever, if a foreigner wants to be able to work in Singapore even prior to securing a job offer, then a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent (PLOC) may be a viable option instead.\nWhat is a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nThe Pre-Approved Letter of Consent allows foreign spouses or unmarried children (below 21 years of age) of a Singaporean citizen or Permanent Resident (who are eligible for an LTVP or LTVP+) to secure jobs faster and switch employment more conveniently. This is because the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent may be applied for without securing a job offer beforehand, as mentioned above.\nThe Pre-Approved Letter of Consent is tied to an individual and not to a specific employer or employment, as opposed to the Letter of Consent which is only valid for the duration of the employment. Therefore, the holder of the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent need not renew or reapply for a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent upon any change of employment.\nSimilar to Letter of Consent holders, there are also\na list of restricted occupations for Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders\n(which is much more exhaustive) such as, but not limited to:\nJournalist;\nArt critic;\nMedia producer/editor; and\nReligion-related occupations.\nWho Can Apply for a Letter of Consent or a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nThe employer or an appointed employment agent can apply for the Letter of Consent. The Letter of Consent will be sent to the employer, and the foreign employee can begin work only when the employer has received the Letter of Consent. It must be noted that only Singapore employers can apply for a Letter of Consent.\nOn the other hand, PLOCs are applied for by eligible foreigners. They will be given the option to apply for a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent when applying for or renewing their LTVP/LTVP+, for no additional fee.\nHow Does the Employer Apply for a Letter of Consent for their Potential Foreign Employee?\nAn application can be submitted online via the Ministry of Manpower’s\nEmployment Pass (EP) eService\n. Before applying for the Letter of Consent however, the employer needs to obtain the potential foreign employee’s written consent to be gainfully employed by that employer.\nThere is no particular format for the fulfilment of this requirement, and the MOM will accept any document that clearly shows a foreign employee’s acceptance of the employer’s job offer. An example of this written consent may be a signed\ncontract of employment\n.\nFor some professions or occupations, additional documents must be submitted when applying for the Letter of Consent. These occupations include:\nRegional representatives of overseas companies\nHealthcare professionals\nLawyers\nFootball players or coaches\nEmployees in food establishments\nFor a detailed list of the additional required documents, please check the\nMinistry of Manpower’s website here\n.\nIf the additional required documents are not in English, then both the original documents, as well as an English translation, must be submitted. The MOM also reserves the right to ask for any other necessary documents while reviewing the Letter of Consent application.\nOnce the letter is approved, the Letter of Consent may be obtained and printed from the EP eService.\nSimilar to the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent, there is no application fee for Letter of Consent applications.\nHow Long Will It Take to Get a Letter of Consent?\nLetter of Consent applications may take 1 week for most cases.\nEmployers may check the application status in the EP eService after 1 week from submission of application. If more information is required, the application may take longer to process.\nWhat is the Duration for the Validity of the Letter of Consent and the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nThe Letter of Consent is valid for the duration indicated by the employer in the Letter of Consent application or until the expiry of the employee’s LTVP or LTVP+, whichever occurs earlier.\nAccordingly, the Letter of Consent stops being valid in the following instances:\nOnce the LTVP or LTVP+ is cancelled;\nOnce the LTVP or LTVP+ expires; or\nIf the foreign employee is no longer employed by the employer that applied for their Letter of Consent. In this instance, however, the employer still needs to cancel the Letter of Consent.\nFor Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders, the duration of the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent will be the same as that of their LTVP/LTVP+. Hence similar to the above, once the LTVP/LTVP+ expires or is cancelled, the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent ceases to be valid.\nIs there a Minimum Salary Requirement to Obtain a Letter of Consent or a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nNo, there is no minimum salary requirement for Letter of Consent and Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders.\nNo foreign worker levy or quota is also required when an employer wishes to hire Letter of Consent or Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders.\nWhat Conditions Must Foreign Employees Abide by to Validly Work Under a Letter of Consent or a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nFor employees under a Letter of Consent\nPer the\nEmployment of Foreign Manpower (Work Passes) Regulations\n, the foreign employee must:\nEngage only in the trade, profession or occupation specified in the Letter of Consent; and\nObtain prior consent from the MOM before engaging in any trade, profession or occupation not specified in the Letter of Consent.\nFurthermore, the foreign employee must inform the MOM, within 7 days, of the:\nTermination or completion (without renewal) of the employment that is the subject of the Letter of Consent; or\nCancellation or expiry (without renewal) of their LTVP or LTVP+.\nFor employees under a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent\nPre-Approved Letter of Consent holders who take up employment in Singapore must show their employer the Pre-Approved Letter of Consent that was issued alongside their valid LTVP/LTVP+.\nOther legal requirements specific to practice of certain professions, such as registration requirements, must also be complied with.\nWhat is the Obligation of an Employer That Wishes to Hire a Potential Employee Holding a Pre-Approved Letter of Consent?\nEmployers of Pre-Approved Letter of Consent holders are required to\nnotify MOM\nof the employment before the employee starts work. They also have to notify the MOM of any termination of employment within 7 days from the employee’s last day of work.\nWhat are the Factors That May Affect the Outcome of an Application for a Letter of Consent?\nEach application is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and the outcome of the application is entirely at the discretion of the MOM. The following are some factors that can affect the successful grant of a Letter of Consent:\nThe potential employee’s age, salary, citizenship, qualifications (including education, work experience and skills).\nThe potential employee’s overall job profile.\nThe economic viability of the Singapore company applying for the Letter of Consent on behalf of the potential employee.\nThe availability of local candidates for the position being offered to the foreign potential employee.

A person with an\nintellectual disability\nhas a developmental disorder where the individual faces more difficulty than others in grasping concepts and solving problems.\nDisabilities can be congenital or acquired later in life, as a result of accidents or medical conditions such as stroke and infections. Some PWDs have\ninvisible disabilities,\nwhich are disabilities that are not immediately obvious. Examples of invisible disabilities include chronic conditions like renal failure, diabetes and sleep problems that affect daily activities of living.\nPWDs tend to have difficulty finding work as they are stereotyped to be less productive than their abled peers in the workforce. Furthermore, such PWDs may face difficulty in the workplace due to their disability and the discrimination they may experience in the workplace.\nIf you are a person with a disability who is looking for work or facing discrimination at work because of your disability, you should know your employment rights under Singapore law and where you can seek employment assistance.\nIn this article, we will be covering:\nEmployment-Related Difficulties that PWDs Face\nPWD job-seekers have difficulty finding work and are often offered work with lower salaries.\nDespite the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) reportedly receiving only “on average about one complaint of discrimination against people with disabilities each year”, disability organisations have noted that PWDs are usually presented with rank-and-file positions. This is in comparison to their well-abled peers who are offered leadership positions.\nFew PWDs occupy leadership or upper management positions because companies do not think they are capable of the work. However, this is a misconception because disabled does not mean unable.\nEven after getting hired, PWDs face employment issues that range from low pay and promotion prospects, a limited choice of jobs and prejudiced supervisors, colleagues or customers.\nNot Sure What To Do Next?\nGet a 20-minute phone call with a lawyer for only $59\nArrange a call now\nExamples:\nAdvice on wrongful termination, non-compete clauses etc.\nSelect\nSelect\nNadia Moynihan\nAugust Law Corporation | 11 years experience | English, Malay\nNadia’s practice encompasses Civil and Commercial Litigation, Matrimonial and Syariah Law as well as Criminal Law.

These laws are found in the Employment Act (EA), Employment Claims Act (ECA) and the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA).\nThe EA states the rights of workers, while the ECA states the regulations surrounding an employment claim and the RRA covers the rights and re-employment of older workers.\nSingapore also has other laws that promote the rights of PWDs, such as the Mental Capacity Act to protect vulnerable PWDs.\nMoreover, the Building Construction Authority’s Code on Accessibility 2013 and 2019 mandates buildings to incorporate requirements that improve accessibility to people of different impairments, lowering the barriers at work for PWDs.\nThe UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was also ratified by Singapore and PWDs should expect to have full and equal rights to employment.\nUpcoming Workplace Fairness Legislation (WFL)\nIn August 2023, the government accepted the final set of\nrecommendations\nby the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness for the Workplace Fairness Legislation (WFL).\nThe WFL will be Singapore’s first anti-discrimination law. It will prohibit workplace discrimination in respect of protected characteristics which include disabilities. The WFL will also prohibit retaliation against employees – such as harassment, salary deductions or dismissal (illustrated below) – who report workplace discrimination.\nThe WFL will coexist with the existing Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP)(discussed below). Meaning, employers will be required to adhere to fair employment practices under the WFL with the prevailing TGFEP.\nThe WFL is slated to be passed in the second half of 2024.\nSeeking Help for Unfair Employment Practices\nUnfair employment practices include workplace discrimination, harassment, salary-related disputes and wrongful dismissal.\nAccording to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP), employers must hire employees on the basis of merit and should not discriminate based on age, race, gender, religion, marital status. family responsibilities or disability.\nAny form of discrimination on irrelevant factors, such as dismissal due to an employee’s disability or for filing a salary-related claim (because the PWD employee was paid a lower salary due to discrimination, or not paid at all), will be in breach of the TGFEP.\nPWDs who encounter unfair employment practices can seek help from the TAFEP. TAFEP will investigate reports of unfair employment practices and can refer cases to the Ministry of Manpower for further action.\nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management Mediation\nThe Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) provides advisory and mediation services to employees and employers to resolve salary-related claims and\nemployment disputes\n. You can make salary-related and wrongful dismissal claims against your employer by registering your claim with TADM.\nSalary-related claims can be filed within 1 year of dispute if you are still employed by the company, or within 6 months from your last day of work if you are no longer employed by the company. The maximum amount claimable is $30,000 for union members and $20,000 for non-union members.\nEmployment Claims Tribunals\nShould the employment dispute remain unresolved after mediation at TADM, you will be issued a claim referral certificate to refer your claim to the\nEmployment Claims Tribunals (ECT)\n.\nLawyers are not allowed to represent any party at the ECT and you must present your case yourself.\nIf you are a union member, a union representative can represent you. If you are unable to represent yourself because of your disability, you can authorise someone to represent you, subject to approval by the tribunal.\nSupport for PWDs Seeking Employment\n1. Upcoming advisory on reasonable accommodations for PWDs\nTo support employment opportunities for PWDs, Singapore is working towards a new advisory to guide employers and employees on the provision of reasonable accommodations for PWDs.\nReasonable accommodations are adjustments to the job or work environment that make it possible for employees with disabilities to perform their jobs. For example, providing a hearing loop system for hard-of-hearing employees, and installing ramps for employees needing wheelchairs.\nWhile the contents of the new advisory will not be a part of the upcoming WFL (mentioned above), it will complement the new law. The advisory is aimed to be released around the same time as the introduction of the WFL.\n2. Employment Support for Persons with Disabilities\nWorkforce Singapore has an\nEmployment Support for Persons with Disabilities\nprogramme to enhance the employability of PWDs and increase their employment options.\nAdministered by SG Enable, this programme helps PWDs gain access to funding, career advisory services, training courses and post-placement job support:\nPWDs can establish their job readiness, and identify possible training and career options with career advisory services from SG Enable’s employment coaches and Job Placement and Job Support partners.\nPWDs are also eligible for course fee subsidies of up to 95% for SG Enable’s list of training courses, which have been curated to enhance their employability and employment options\nTraining benefits for PWDs are provided by the Workfare Skills Support scheme:\nA training allowance of $6 per hour for PWDs\nA training commitment award of $100 per completed course\n3.

A person with an\nintellectual disability\nhas a developmental disorder where the individual faces more difficulty than others in grasping concepts and solving problems.\nDisabilities can be congenital or acquired later in life, as a result of accidents or medical conditions such as stroke and infections. Some PWDs have\ninvisible disabilities,\nwhich are disabilities that are not immediately obvious. Examples of invisible disabilities include chronic conditions like renal failure, diabetes and sleep problems that affect daily activities of living.\nPWDs tend to have difficulty finding work as they are stereotyped to be less productive than their abled peers in the workforce. Furthermore, such PWDs may face difficulty in the workplace due to their disability and the discrimination they may experience in the workplace.\nIf you are a person with a disability who is looking for work or facing discrimination at work because of your disability, you should know your employment rights under Singapore law and where you can seek employment assistance.\nIn this article, we will be covering:\nEmployment-Related Difficulties that PWDs Face\nPWD job-seekers have difficulty finding work and are often offered work with lower salaries.\nDespite the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) reportedly receiving only “on average about one complaint of discrimination against people with disabilities each year”, disability organisations have noted that PWDs are usually presented with rank-and-file positions. This is in comparison to their well-abled peers who are offered leadership positions.\nFew PWDs occupy leadership or upper management positions because companies do not think they are capable of the work. However, this is a misconception because disabled does not mean unable.\nEven after getting hired, PWDs face employment issues that range from low pay and promotion prospects, a limited choice of jobs and prejudiced supervisors, colleagues or customers.\nNot Sure What To Do Next?\nGet a 20-minute phone call with a lawyer for only $59\nArrange a call now\nExamples:\nAdvice on wrongful termination, non-compete clauses etc.\nSelect\nSelect\nNadia Moynihan\nAugust Law Corporation | 11 years experience | English, Malay\nNadia’s practice encompasses Civil and Commercial Litigation, Matrimonial and Syariah Law as well as Criminal Law.

These laws are found in the Employment Act (EA), Employment Claims Act (ECA) and the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA).\nThe EA states the rights of workers, while the ECA states the regulations surrounding an employment claim and the RRA covers the rights and re-employment of older workers.\nSingapore also has other laws that promote the rights of PWDs, such as the Mental Capacity Act to protect vulnerable PWDs.\nMoreover, the Building Construction Authority’s Code on Accessibility 2013 and 2019 mandates buildings to incorporate requirements that improve accessibility to people of different impairments, lowering the barriers at work for PWDs.\nThe UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was also ratified by Singapore and PWDs should expect to have full and equal rights to employment.\nUpcoming Workplace Fairness Legislation (WFL)\nIn August 2023, the government accepted the final set of\nrecommendations\nby the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness for the Workplace Fairness Legislation (WFL).\nThe WFL will be Singapore’s first anti-discrimination law.

Meaning, employers will be required to adhere to fair employment practices under the WFL with the prevailing TGFEP.\nThe WFL is slated to be passed in the second half of 2024.\nSeeking Help for Unfair Employment Practices\nUnfair employment practices include workplace discrimination, harassment, salary-related disputes and wrongful dismissal.\nAccording to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP), employers must hire employees on the basis of merit and should not discriminate based on age, race, gender, religion, marital status. family responsibilities or disability.\nAny form of discrimination on irrelevant factors, such as dismissal due to an employee’s disability or for filing a salary-related claim (because the PWD employee was paid a lower salary due to discrimination, or not paid at all), will be in breach of the TGFEP.\nPWDs who encounter unfair employment practices can seek help from the TAFEP.

{"chunk_id": "SLA_31e8671f", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "A Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Hiring Employees > A Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law", "text": "A Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nLast updated on October 25, 2024\nIn Singapore, there are various sources of employment law which govern the rights and obligations of employers and employees. Our employment law framework consists of both binding laws (e.g. the Employment Act, Workplace Safety and Health Act) and non-binding guidelines (e.g. Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices).\nAs a whole, these laws and guidelines cover different areas of Singapore’s employment law framework ranging from hiring practices, payment of salaries, dispute resolution to work injury compensation. For instance, the Employment Act, Singapore’s main employment legislation, covers aspects such as\nleave entitlements\n,\nCPF contributions\nand\nsalary payments\n.\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is the main enforcer of the Employment Act. Apart from MOM, there are other agencies which have purview over Singapore’s employment laws, such as the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), which was established to advance fair, responsible and progressive employment practices. There is also the Workplace Safety and Health Council, a statutory body under MOM which aims to improve safety and health standards in the workplace.\nThis article provides an overview of Singapore’s employment law framework for employers and employees. It discusses:\nDoes the Employment Act Apply to All Singapore Employees?\nThe Employment Act applies to all employees, including local and foreign employees, who have entered into a “contract of service” with an employer. Foreign companies based in Singapore are also required to comply with our local laws regarding employment.\nThe types of employees covered under the Employment Act include:\nWorkmen\n: This refers to someone whose work consists mainly of manual labour or whose job is identified in the\nFirst Schedule\nof the Employment Act (e.g. construction workers, cleaners, machine operators and bus/train drivers).\nPersons in managerial or executive positions (PMEs)\n: These are employees with executive and supervisory functions, and they also include professionals such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and dentists.\nHowever, there are certain exceptions. The Employment Act does not cover the following types of employees:\nSeafarers\nDomestic workers\nPublic officers (i.e. civil servants and employees of statutory boards)\nFor such employees, their employment contract determines the terms and conditions of their employment.\nIt should also be noted that Part IV of the Employment Act, which relates to specific conditions of service such as rest days, working hours and overtime pay, only applies to the following employees:\nWorkmen earning a monthly basic salary of $4,500 or below.\nOther employees (who are not workmen) but are covered by the Employment Act and earn a monthly basic salary of $2,600 or below.\nPart IV does not apply to persons in managerial or executive positions.\nWhat Do the Employment Laws and Various Employment-Related Legislation Cover?\nAs mentioned above, there are various laws governing employment in Singapore, with the main one being the Employment Act.\nWhat does the Employment Act cover?\nThe Employment Act stipulates the basic terms and working conditions for employees (including full-time, part-time, contract and temporary employees). Broadly, the Act covers contracts of service, payment of salaries, conditions of service such as working hours and rest days, and annual and sick leave.\nEmployees who do not fall under the Employment Act (as explained above) may be protected by other forms of legislation. For example, domestic workers are protected by the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act while seafarers are protected by the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) (Seafarer Recruitment and Placement Services) Regulations.\nIf employers do not adhere to the Employment Act, they may face legal penalties such as fines and/or imprisonment. Examples of breaches of the Employment Act include failure to pay salaries to workers and making employees work excessive hours. The precise penalty imposed on the employer depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.\nWhat do the other types of legislation cover?\nApart from the Employment Act, there are also various other employment-related legislation in Singapore spanning specific aspects of employment law:\nWork Injury Compensation Act\n: This allows employees who have sustained injuries or developed diseases in the course of their work to seek compensation from their employers. Additionally, the Act also covers compensation for accidental deaths that occur during the course of work.\nChild Development Co-Savings Act\n: This sets out the maternity and paternity benefits for employees such as paid maternity leave, childcare leave and adoption leave.\nRetirement and Re-Employment Act\n: This specifies the minimum retirement age and also covers the re-employment of eligible employees past the retirement age.\nCentral Provident Fund Act\n: This mandates that companies contribute to their employees’ CPF accounts for retirement purposes.\nWhat Do the Tripartite Guidelines on Various Employment Matters Cover?\nApart from the official laws and legislation described above, there are also non-binding guidelines that cover a wide scope of employment-related matters such as fair employment practices, flexible work arrangements and wrongful dismissal. Here is a brief overview of some of the guidelines:\nTripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices\n: These guidelines set out fair and responsible employment practices that should be adopted by employers in order to prevent workplace discrimination and cultivate a more progressive working environment for all.\nTripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests\n: These are guidelines on how employees should make formal requests for flexible work arrangements, and how employers should respond to such requests.\nTripartite Guidelines on\nWrongful Dismissal\n: These guidelines provide practical examples of what does and does not constitute a wrongful dismissal.\nTripartite Guidelines on\nRe-employment of Older Employees\n: These guidelines set out best practices for employers re-hiring employees beyond the retirement age, such as preparing employees for re-employment, preparing a re-employment contract and recognising the contributions of re-employed employees.\nTripartite Guidelines on Mandatory\nRetrenchment\nNotifications\n: These guidelines set out the procedures that employers have to comply with when conducting retrenchment exercises. Do refer to our article to learn more about\nemployee rights in relation to retrenchment in Singapore\n.\nAdditionally, there are also guidelines that complement the legislation. For example, the Workplace Safety and Health Act is accompanied by the\nCode of Practice for Workplace Safety and Health\n, which supplements existing regulations on health and safety in the workplace and provides guidance to employers on ensuring compliance with the Workplace Safety and Health Act.\nAre the Tripartite guidelines legally binding?\nThe Tripartite guidelines are not legally binding, unlike the laws and legislation covered in the previous section.\nHowever, this does not mean that there are no consequences if employers fail to comply with the guidelines. On the contrary, MOM has stated that employers are expected to adhere to the guidelines and that non-compliance may result in MOM taking action against employers.\nFor example, if Company A is in breach of the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (e.g. by putting out job advertisements indicating a preference for a specific race or hiring based on one’s marital status and family commitments), MOM may place that company on the Fair Consideration Framework Watchlist, which means that Company A’s work pass applications will be scrutinised more carefully for discriminatory hiring practices. Company A may also have to undergo counselling by TAFEP. Recalcitrant employers may even have their work pass privileges suspended.\nWhat Avenues of Recourse Do Employees have Against Employers?\nIf an employee has a grievance with their employer over the Employment Act, they may turn to the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), which assists employees with employment disputes such as salary and dismissal-related issues. The TADM provides advisory and mediation services.

Our employment law framework consists of both binding laws (e.g. the Employment Act, Workplace Safety and Health Act) and non-binding guidelines (e.g. Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices).\nAs a whole, these laws and guidelines cover different areas of Singapore’s employment law framework ranging from hiring practices, payment of salaries, dispute resolution to work injury compensation. For instance, the Employment Act, Singapore’s main employment legislation, covers aspects such as\nleave entitlements\n,\nCPF contributions\nand\nsalary payments\n.\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is the main enforcer of the Employment Act. Apart from MOM, there are other agencies which have purview over Singapore’s employment laws, such as the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), which was established to advance fair, responsible and progressive employment practices. There is also the Workplace Safety and Health Council, a statutory body under MOM which aims to improve safety and health standards in the workplace.\nThis article provides an overview of Singapore’s employment law framework for employers and employees. It discusses:\nDoes the Employment Act Apply to All Singapore Employees?\nThe Employment Act applies to all employees, including local and foreign employees, who have entered into a “contract of service” with an employer. Foreign companies based in Singapore are also required to comply with our local laws regarding employment.\nThe types of employees covered under the Employment Act include:\nWorkmen\n: This refers to someone whose work consists mainly of manual labour or whose job is identified in the\nFirst Schedule\nof the Employment Act (e.g. construction workers, cleaners, machine operators and bus/train drivers).\nPersons in managerial or executive positions (PMEs)\n: These are employees with executive and supervisory functions, and they also include professionals such as lawyers, accountants, doctors and dentists.\nHowever, there are certain exceptions. The Employment Act does not cover the following types of employees:\nSeafarers\nDomestic workers\nPublic officers (i.e. civil servants and employees of statutory boards)\nFor such employees, their employment contract determines the terms and conditions of their employment.\nIt should also be noted that Part IV of the Employment Act, which relates to specific conditions of service such as rest days, working hours and overtime pay, only applies to the following employees:\nWorkmen earning a monthly basic salary of $4,500 or below.\nOther employees (who are not workmen) but are covered by the Employment Act and earn a monthly basic salary of $2,600 or below.\nPart IV does not apply to persons in managerial or executive positions.\nWhat Do the Employment Laws and Various Employment-Related Legislation Cover?\nAs mentioned above, there are various laws governing employment in Singapore, with the main one being the Employment Act.\nWhat does the Employment Act cover?\nThe Employment Act stipulates the basic terms and working conditions for employees (including full-time, part-time, contract and temporary employees). Broadly, the Act covers contracts of service, payment of salaries, conditions of service such as working hours and rest days, and annual and sick leave.\nEmployees who do not fall under the Employment Act (as explained above) may be protected by other forms of legislation. For example, domestic workers are protected by the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act while seafarers are protected by the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) (Seafarer Recruitment and Placement Services) Regulations.\nIf employers do not adhere to the Employment Act, they may face legal penalties such as fines and/or imprisonment. Examples of breaches of the Employment Act include failure to pay salaries to workers and making employees work excessive hours. The precise penalty imposed on the employer depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.\nWhat do the other types of legislation cover?\nApart from the Employment Act, there are also various other employment-related legislation in Singapore spanning specific aspects of employment law:\nWork Injury Compensation Act\n: This allows employees who have sustained injuries or developed diseases in the course of their work to seek compensation from their employers. Additionally, the Act also covers compensation for accidental deaths that occur during the course of work.\nChild Development Co-Savings Act\n: This sets out the maternity and paternity benefits for employees such as paid maternity leave, childcare leave and adoption leave.\nRetirement and Re-Employment Act\n: This specifies the minimum retirement age and also covers the re-employment of eligible employees past the retirement age.\nCentral Provident Fund Act\n: This mandates that companies contribute to their employees’ CPF accounts for retirement purposes.\nWhat Do the Tripartite Guidelines on Various Employment Matters Cover?\nApart from the official laws and legislation described above, there are also non-binding guidelines that cover a wide scope of employment-related matters such as fair employment practices, flexible work arrangements and wrongful dismissal. Here is a brief overview of some of the guidelines:\nTripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices\n: These guidelines set out fair and responsible employment practices that should be adopted by employers in order to prevent workplace discrimination and cultivate a more progressive working environment for all.\nTripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests\n: These are guidelines on how employees should make formal requests for flexible work arrangements, and how employers should respond to such requests.\nTripartite Guidelines on\nWrongful Dismissal\n: These guidelines provide practical examples of what does and does not constitute a wrongful dismissal.\nTripartite Guidelines on\nRe-employment of Older Employees\n: These guidelines set out best practices for employers re-hiring employees beyond the retirement age, such as preparing employees for re-employment, preparing a re-employment contract and recognising the contributions of re-employed employees.\nTripartite Guidelines on Mandatory\nRetrenchment\nNotifications\n: These guidelines set out the procedures that employers have to comply with when conducting retrenchment exercises. Do refer to our article to learn more about\nemployee rights in relation to retrenchment in Singapore\n.\nAdditionally, there are also guidelines that complement the legislation. For example, the Workplace Safety and Health Act is accompanied by the\nCode of Practice for Workplace Safety and Health\n, which supplements existing regulations on health and safety in the workplace and provides guidance to employers on ensuring compliance with the Workplace Safety and Health Act.\nAre the Tripartite guidelines legally binding?\nThe Tripartite guidelines are not legally binding, unlike the laws and legislation covered in the previous section.\nHowever, this does not mean that there are no consequences if employers fail to comply with the guidelines. On the contrary, MOM has stated that employers are expected to adhere to the guidelines and that non-compliance may result in MOM taking action against employers.\nFor example, if Company A is in breach of the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (e.g. by putting out job advertisements indicating a preference for a specific race or hiring based on one’s marital status and family commitments), MOM may place that company on the Fair Consideration Framework Watchlist, which means that Company A’s work pass applications will be scrutinised more carefully for discriminatory hiring practices. Company A may also have to undergo counselling by TAFEP. Recalcitrant employers may even have their work pass privileges suspended.\nWhat Avenues of Recourse Do Employees have Against Employers?\nIf an employee has a grievance with their employer over the Employment Act, they may turn to the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), which assists employees with employment disputes such as salary and dismissal-related issues. The TADM provides advisory and mediation services. If mediation fails, employees may file a claim at the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT).\nIf employees are facing workplace discrimination, harassment or other unfair practices, they may seek recourse from the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP). Complaints may also be made to MOM, which will then investigate claims of employment infringement. Examples of employment infringement include non-payment of salaries, workplace harassment and wrongful termination.\nFor a more detailed discussion on the avenues of legal recourse for employees, do refer to our article on\ncommon employment disputes and how you can deal with them\n.\n—\nTo conclude, both employers and employees are subject to laws and guidelines that make up Singapore’s comprehensive employment law framework. As shown above, there are a variety of rules to navigate from both the legislation as well as the accompanying guidelines.\nAn employment lawyer will be able to help employers better understand their legal obligations and ensure that their businesses are run in compliance with the existing regulatory framework to prevent running afoul of the law.\nAs for employees, an employment lawyer can give you information on how best to protect your interests in the workplace and advise you on the most suitable course of action to take if you have a specific claim that you wish to raise against your employer.\nIf you are looking for an employment lawyer to consult, here is our\nguide on how to choose a good employment lawyer in Singapore\n.

Decide Whether You Want to Hire an Employee On a Full-Time, Part-Time or Term Contract Basis\nFull-time\nA full-time employee is typically responsible for the day-to-day operations and core functions of a business. They are hired under a contract of service for an unspecified period of time, which will run until terminated by either the employer or employee.\nTermination is to be carried out via written notice, and the length of which is to be determined either by the terms of the contract or in proportion to the length of employment, under the Employment Act (EA).\nPart-time\nA part-time employee may play a more supportive function in a company or organisation as compared to a full-time employee. They are hired under a contract of service to work less than 35 hours a week and also enjoy protection by the EA through the\nEmployment of Part-Time Employees Regulations\n. The contract of service must contain the following terms:\nHourly basic rate of pay;\nHourly gross rate of pay (the hourly basic rate plus allowances);\nNumber of working hours per day or per week; and\nNumber of working days per week or per month.\nTerm contract\nOn the other hand, term contract employees are hired on fixed-term contracts of employment when the job is only available on a temporary or project basis or when they face a headcount constraint (i.e. the number of people the company can employ is restricted). These fixed-term contracts will terminate upon the expiry of a specific term or period (such as a date), unless it is renewed.\nThe\nTripartite Standard on the Employment of Term Contract Employees\nspecifies a set of term-contract employment best practices that all employers should implement at the workplace for their term contract employees. In particular, if your term contract employee has provided continuous service for 3 months or more, you must provide statutory leave benefits under the EA and the Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA), such as annual leave and medical leave. Continuous service refers to term contracts lasting 14 days or more, which are renewed within 1 month from the end of the previous contract.\nFor all types of employment contracts, you should abide by all the relevant\nTripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices\n.\n2. Apply for a Central Provident Fund (CPF) Submission Number\nTo hire a Singaporean or Singapore PR employee, you need to\napply for a CPF Submission Number (CSN) to make CPF contributions\nas an employer. Every month, you must contribute two portions of money to your employees’ CPF accounts:\nThe employee’s contribution, which consists of 20% of their wages; and\nThe employer’s contribution, which consists of 17% of the employee’s wage.\nAs an employer, you are permitted to deduct the employee’s share of the mandatory CPF contributions from their wages if your employees are earning more than $500 per month.\nFor more information about CPF and the respective contribution rates of employees and employers, please refer to our other article on\nmaking CPF contributions\n.\nThe due date for CPF contributions is on the last day of the calendar month. You can easily submit your CPF contributions via CPF EZPay and CPF EZPay Mobile.\n3. Invite and Shortlist Job Applicants\nNext, you should put up fair\njob advertisements\nthat do not discriminate against applicants based on age, gender, race, religion, marital status and family responsibilities or disability.\nYou can post advertisements on several online platforms such as MyCareersFuture, LinkedIn, or Indeed. Do note that if you are looking to hire foreigners on an Employment Pass, you must first advertise the job on MyCareersFuture for at least 28 consecutive days.\nWhen reviewing\nresumes or job application forms\n, you should assess information only directly related to the qualifications, skills, knowledge, and experience required for the job.\nLastly, set up\ninterviews\nwith the job applicants to ensure that you are hiring a suitable candidate for your business. Your interviews should focus on merit-based and non-discriminatory questions and/or assessments.\n4. Make an Employment Offer and Sign the Employment Agreement\nOnce you have found a suitable candidate for the job, you will then negotiate the\nKey Employment Terms\n(KETs) and send them an\noffer letter\n. The offer can be verbal or in writing, although you are recommended to make a written offer to minimise potential disputes.\nYou can use our\nFind a Lawyer service\nto engage an employment lawyer, who can help with the drafting of employment offers.\nThe KETs include:\nJob title, responsibilities and main duties of employee\nWorking arrangements (working hours, working days and rest days)\nBasic salary, salary period and other salary-related components\nTypes of leave and medical benefits\nProbation period and notice period\nA\nsample KETs form\nis available on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) website. You can also use MOM’s KETs verification tool to check if work arrangements, salary and other components meet the EA requirements.\nOnce your offer has been accepted by the job applicant, you will need to sign an employment agreement, also known as a contract of service, which sets out the terms governing the relationship between an employer and an employee. You must include the KETs in the employment agreement. Your employee is also required to sign and return the employment agreement to you.\nFor further information, please refer to this\nguide to employment agreements in Singapore\n. If you require an Employment Agreement template, you can purchase one\nhere\n.\nNevertheless, since the employment agreement is an important legal document for both you and your employee, you are encouraged to\nengage an employment lawyer\nfor the drafting of an employment agreement. This is to ensure the legal preciseness of the contract, as well as for it to be as comprehensive as possible.\n5. Purchase Work Injury Compensation Insurance\nYou are also required to purchase work injury compensation insurance for all employees doing\nmanual work\n(regardless of their salary levels), as well as all employees\nearning $2,600 or less a month\n. This requirement applies for both local and foreign employees.\nFor other employees (i.e. those not doing manual work and/or earning above the salary threshold of $2,600 or less a month), you have the flexibility to decide whether to purchase insurance for them.\nYou can find a work injury compensation designated insurer using\nthis list\n.\nHiring Foreign Employees in Singapore\nThere are additional steps involved if you are hiring a foreign employee in Singapore:\nSet up a\nWork Pass Account\nto register for online accounts and declare your business activity\nFamiliarise yourself with all the rules about:\nDependency ceiling ratio\n(the maximum ratio of foreign employees to the total workforce that a company in a given sector can employ);\nForeign worker levy\n(a pricing mechanism to regulate the number of foreigners in Singapore) for work permit and S pass; and\nThe\nfair consideration framework\n, which sets out requirements for all employers to consider the Singapore workforce fairly for job opportunities.\nApply and obtain appropriate work passes for the foreign employees via Work Permit Online (WPOL) or Employment Pass Online (EPOL)\nFor more information, please refer to our other article on\nhiring foreign workers in Singapore\n.\nHiring Remote Workers in Singapore\nYou may wish to consider whether you are able to implement Flexible Work Arrangements such as remote working into your business.\nRemote working, also known as telecommuting, is a working style that allows professionals to work outside of a traditional office environment (e.g. working from home).\nFor more information, please refer to\nthis article on hiring remote employees\n.\nOngoing Employer Obligations\nMonthly obligations\nAll employers must\nissue itemised pay slips\nto employees covered by the EA. The payslips should include information such as your employee’s basic pay, overtime pay, bonuses, CPF deductions and other salary-related matters.\nYou must issue the payslips together with the salary paid to your employee. If you are unable to issue both together, then you must give the payslip within 3 working days of issuing the salary.\nAs an employer, you will also have to\npay the Skills Development Levy (SDL)\nfor all your employees working in Singapore, regardless of their employment type or nationality. The SDL funds will be collected by the CPF Board and channelled into a Skills Development Fund.\nManaged by the SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (SSG), these funds will be used to support workforce upgrading programmes under the national Continuing Education Training (CET) system.\nAdditionally, you are expected to deduct your employees’\ncontributions to self-help groups (SHG)\nfrom their wages. The SHGs were set up to uplift the less privileged, low-income households in Singapore.\nSHG funds are made payable to different organisations in accordance with the employee’s race or religion and are also collected by the CPF Board.\nBoth the SDL and SHG funds can be\npaid together with your employee’s CPF contributions\n.\nYearly obligations\nAs an employer, you are also required to\nreport the remuneration of your employees to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)\nby 1 March every year for tax purposes.\nPlease check out the\nIRAS website\nfor the relevant tax forms.\nFor employers with a total of 5 or more employees for the entire year or those who have received the “Notice to File Employment Income Of Employees Electronically”, there is a compulsory\nAuto Inclusion Scheme (AIS) for Employment Income\n.\nEmployers will have to submit their employees’ income information to IRAS electronically and this information will be pre-filled in their employees’ electronic Income Tax Returns. AIS employers do not need to issue any hardcopy forms and appendices to their employees.\n—\nAs an employer, there are several steps that you will need to undertake if you are looking to hire employees in Singapore. In addition, you should take note that you are required to comply with a number of legal obligations, such as making monthly CPF contributions for your local employees.\nAlthough it appears that there is a lot to be done when hiring employees, this process can ultimately prove to be rewarding as your new employees can help to take over various business operations, grow your revenue and expand the business further.\nTo reiterate, you are recommended to\nconsult an employment lawyer\n, who can advise you on the legal context that frames your employer-employee relationships and assist you with the drafting of offer letters and employment agreements.\nAdditionally, if you require assistance with human resources (HR) and payroll processing issues, you may choose to consult a corporate services firm to ensure that your business runs smoothly.

Invite and Shortlist Job Applicants\nNext, you should put up fair\njob advertisements\nthat do not discriminate against applicants based on age, gender, race, religion, marital status and family responsibilities or disability.\nYou can post advertisements on several online platforms such as MyCareersFuture, LinkedIn, or Indeed. Do note that if you are looking to hire foreigners on an Employment Pass, you must first advertise the job on MyCareersFuture for at least 28 consecutive days.\nWhen reviewing\nresumes or job application forms\n, you should assess information only directly related to the qualifications, skills, knowledge, and experience required for the job.\nLastly, set up\ninterviews\nwith the job applicants to ensure that you are hiring a suitable candidate for your business. Your interviews should focus on merit-based and non-discriminatory questions and/or assessments.\n4. Make an Employment Offer and Sign the Employment Agreement\nOnce you have found a suitable candidate for the job, you will then negotiate the\nKey Employment Terms\n(KETs) and send them an\noffer letter\n. The offer can be verbal or in writing, although you are recommended to make a written offer to minimise potential disputes.\nYou can use our\nFind a Lawyer service\nto engage an employment lawyer, who can help with the drafting of employment offers.\nThe KETs include:\nJob title, responsibilities and main duties of employee\nWorking arrangements (working hours, working days and rest days)\nBasic salary, salary period and other salary-related components\nTypes of leave and medical benefits\nProbation period and notice period\nA\nsample KETs form\nis available on the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) website. You can also use MOM’s KETs verification tool to check if work arrangements, salary and other components meet the EA requirements.\nOnce your offer has been accepted by the job applicant, you will need to sign an employment agreement, also known as a contract of service, which sets out the terms governing the relationship between an employer and an employee. You must include the KETs in the employment agreement. Your employee is also required to sign and return the employment agreement to you.\nFor further information, please refer to this\nguide to employment agreements in Singapore\n. If you require an Employment Agreement template, you can purchase one\nhere\n.\nNevertheless, since the employment agreement is an important legal document for both you and your employee, you are encouraged to\nengage an employment lawyer\nfor the drafting of an employment agreement. This is to ensure the legal preciseness of the contract, as well as for it to be as comprehensive as possible.\n5. Purchase Work Injury Compensation Insurance\nYou are also required to purchase work injury compensation insurance for all employees doing\nmanual work\n(regardless of their salary levels), as well as all employees\nearning $2,600 or less a month\n. This requirement applies for both local and foreign employees.\nFor other employees (i.e. those not doing manual work and/or earning above the salary threshold of $2,600 or less a month), you have the flexibility to decide whether to purchase insurance for them.\nYou can find a work injury compensation designated insurer using\nthis list\n.\nHiring Foreign Employees in Singapore\nThere are additional steps involved if you are hiring a foreign employee in Singapore:\nSet up a\nWork Pass Account\nto register for online accounts and declare your business activity\nFamiliarise yourself with all the rules about:\nDependency ceiling ratio\n(the maximum ratio of foreign employees to the total workforce that a company in a given sector can employ);\nForeign worker levy\n(a pricing mechanism to regulate the number of foreigners in Singapore) for work permit and S pass; and\nThe\nfair consideration framework\n, which sets out requirements for all employers to consider the Singapore workforce fairly for job opportunities.\nApply and obtain appropriate work passes for the foreign employees via Work Permit Online (WPOL) or Employment Pass Online (EPOL)\nFor more information, please refer to our other article on\nhiring foreign workers in Singapore\n.\nHiring Remote Workers in Singapore\nYou may wish to consider whether you are able to implement Flexible Work Arrangements such as remote working into your business.\nRemote working, also known as telecommuting, is a working style that allows professionals to work outside of a traditional office environment (e.g. working from home).\nFor more information, please refer to\nthis article on hiring remote employees\n.\nOngoing Employer Obligations\nMonthly obligations\nAll employers must\nissue itemised pay slips\nto employees covered by the EA. The payslips should include information such as your employee’s basic pay, overtime pay, bonuses, CPF deductions and other salary-related matters.\nYou must issue the payslips together with the salary paid to your employee. If you are unable to issue both together, then you must give the payslip within 3 working days of issuing the salary.\nAs an employer, you will also have to\npay the Skills Development Levy (SDL)\nfor all your employees working in Singapore, regardless of their employment type or nationality. The SDL funds will be collected by the CPF Board and channelled into a Skills Development Fund.\nManaged by the SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (SSG), these funds will be used to support workforce upgrading programmes under the national Continuing Education Training (CET) system.\nAdditionally, you are expected to deduct your employees’\ncontributions to self-help groups (SHG)\nfrom their wages. The SHGs were set up to uplift the less privileged, low-income households in Singapore.\nSHG funds are made payable to different organisations in accordance with the employee’s race or religion and are also collected by the CPF Board.\nBoth the SDL and SHG funds can be\npaid together with your employee’s CPF contributions\n.\nYearly obligations\nAs an employer, you are also required to\nreport the remuneration of your employees to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)\nby 1 March every year for tax purposes.\nPlease check out the\nIRAS website\nfor the relevant tax forms.\nFor employers with a total of 5 or more employees for the entire year or those who have received the “Notice to File Employment Income Of Employees Electronically”, there is a compulsory\nAuto Inclusion Scheme (AIS) for Employment Income\n.\nEmployers will have to submit their employees’ income information to IRAS electronically and this information will be pre-filled in their employees’ electronic Income Tax Returns. AIS employers do not need to issue any hardcopy forms and appendices to their employees.\n—\nAs an employer, there are several steps that you will need to undertake if you are looking to hire employees in Singapore. In addition, you should take note that you are required to comply with a number of legal obligations, such as making monthly CPF contributions for your local employees.\nAlthough it appears that there is a lot to be done when hiring employees, this process can ultimately prove to be rewarding as your new employees can help to take over various business operations, grow your revenue and expand the business further.\nTo reiterate, you are recommended to\nconsult an employment lawyer\n, who can advise you on the legal context that frames your employer-employee relationships and assist you with the drafting of offer letters and employment agreements.\nAdditionally, if you require assistance with human resources (HR) and payroll processing issues, you may choose to consult a corporate services firm to ensure that your business runs smoothly.

Covid-19 was also a main factor pushing many companies to implement work-from-home policies. Even though there is a greater push for back-to-office work now that Covid-19 is not a menace, work from home is here is stay.\nWhat is a Work From Home Policy?\nA work from home policy is a set of company guidelines allowing employees to work from home. These guidelines cover matters such as employees’ eligibility for working from home as well as the responsibilities and expectations of both employers and employees while working from home.\nFor avoidance of doubt, the terms “telecommuting” and “work from home” are generally used interchangeably.\nHowever, strictly speaking, work from home is a form of telecommuting, which generally refers to a flexible work arrangement that allows one to work outside of the office (flexi-place). Hence, it is possible for employees to work from any remote area, other than their homes, under a work from home policy.\nYour work from home arrangement also can either be stand-alone or part of a broader flexible work arrangement.\nIs It Compulsory for You to Implement Work From Home Arrangements?\nAs of now, all employers must have a process in place for workers to make formal requests for flexible work arrangements. Flexible work arrangements include “flexi-place”, for example work from home arrangements, “flexi-time” (working at different timings with no change in hours and workload), and “flexi-load” (different workloads with commensurate pay, for example part-time work). Employers are expected to consider such requests based on reasonable business grounds that are directly linked to business outcomes. Employers are also expected to give a formal answer to such requests.\nThis is based on the compulsory Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests and it is more of a baseline standard. Companies serious about having a work-from-home policy would have to make more detailed operational plans to facilitate it.\nShould You Implement Work From Home Arrangements?\nEven where work from home arrangements are not compulsory, the Ministry of Manpower still encourages their implementation due to the many benefits this can bring. These may include:\nAttraction and retention of employees:\nOffering the option to work from home may make you a more attractive employer as there may be employees who prefer working from home.\nGreater work-life balance for employees\n: Your employees may be able to enjoy a better\nwork-life balance\n. The decrease in commute time means that employees will be able to spend more time on their own pursuits. Those with young children or elderly parents will be able to better perform their family responsibilities because they can be home more often.\nIncreased productivity\n: For some employees, the elimination of office distractions, such as colleagues talking to each other, may also translate to greater productivity. The decrease in time spent on commuting also means that your employees will have more time to rest and recharge.\nSolution to manpower crunch\n: You will have access to a greater manpower base and talent pool. This is because you may have the option of employing those who are unable to commit to office-based work due to family responsibilities or other reasons.\nBetter preparedness for emergency situations\n: Implementing work from home arrangements will allow your company to quickly\ncommence business continuity plans\nduring times of crisis. This could be where your employees cannot work from the office as it has been destroyed by fire, for example. This way, your company will already have the infrastructure and experience required to efficiently execute such plans.\nHow to Write a Work From Home Policy in Singapore\nYou may find certain challenges when it comes to implementing work from home arrangements.\nFor example, there may be risks of miscommunication or threats to company security. It is therefore important to draft and implement a well-considered work from home policy to minimise the occurrence of such problems from the outset.\nBelow are some key terms that you may consider including in your company’s work from home policy:\n1. Eligibility\nThe policy should state which employees will be allowed to take advantage of such a policy. For example, it may be appropriate to include employees in charge of backend processes, but not employees in charge of office reception who need to manage visitors in person.\nOn this note, you may wish to list in the policy the factors that will be considered in deciding whether to grant an employee’s work from home request.\nFor example, one additional factor could be the suitability of the employee to work from home. Some employees may be better able to maintain good communication with their colleagues while working from home, while others may not.\nWork days\nThe policy should also clearly state when and how often employees will be allowed to work from home. For example, you may offer certain fixed “work from home days” in the week. If you do so, you should state in the policy whether employees can request to work in the office on their work from home days.\nAlternatively, you may allow your employees to request to work from home when they need to do so. If so, you should provide examples of when your employees may submit an ad hoc work from home request. For example, some acceptable reasons may include:\nParenting/eldercare responsibilities\nMedical appointments\nHome emergencies\nMental health requirements\nYou should make it clear whether providing one of the accepted reasons listed in the request will result in guaranteed approval, or whether the request will still be subject to approval (more below).\nIf you wish to exclude certain days or periods in the year in which working from home is not permissible, you should also state so explicitly in your policy to prevent any misunderstandings. For example, you may require your employees to be in office when there will be an all-hands meeting.\n2. Request/approval process\nThe policy should clearly lay out the process of making requests to work from home. You should consider what sort of process would suit your company.\nFor instance, should employees make a formal request to HR, or do they have to obtain the approval of their supervisor? You may also wish to state whether employees must declare their place of work, or they may work at any location they like.\nIn this regard, the above-mentioned\nTripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements (TSFWA)\noffers some guidance.\nAccording to the TSFWA, you should train supervisors to objectively evaluate employees’ applications for working from home. You should also aim to communicate the outcomes of work from home applications in a timely manner.\nIf you are unable to grant a work from home request, the TSFWA recommends that you explain to employees the reasons why and where possible, discuss suitable alternatives.\nFor example, if they requested for an arrangement to work from home, but are needed on-site on a particular day, you could grant them an extra day of work from home the following week.\n3. Expectations and responsibilities\nThe work from home policy should include any standards that will be expected of the employee.\nFor example, if the employee will have to communicate with clients or business partners through video-conferencing tools while working from home, it may be helpful to include a term on the expected dress code for such meetings.\nFor jobs that require a high degree of confidentiality, it might make sense to include a term stating that the employee should work only at home, as opposed to external venues such as cafes and libraries.\nThis would help prevent breaches of confidentiality arising from, for example, others viewing the employee’s computer screen or overhearing confidential conversations, or the employee connecting to unsecure public Wi-Fi networks.\nCommunication\nAnother term that should be included is the expected response time of the employee. You should set out clearly whether the employee must always be contactable, or whether it would be sufficient for him or her to check his or her messages every hour or so.\nYou should also state the preferred mode of communication, be it through email, text or call. Lastly, you may also wish to state how frequently the employee will need to report his or her progress to the manager.\nBy laying out these expectations clearly, misunderstandings can be minimised and the employee can also be kept accountable.\n4. Equipment and technical support\nProper equipment is crucial for your employees to work productively from home. Your policy should state whether the company will be providing the employee with necessary equipment such as laptops or mobile phones.\nIf that is not feasible, you may wish to provide your employee with remote desktop software so that he or she can access his or her work desktop from his or her home computer.\nAdditionally, the policy should outline the procedure in case the employee experiences technical difficulties while working from home. For example, how would the technical support team extend help to the employee, and how would the employee be expected to respond to work emergencies?\nIn this regard, you may also wish to invest in remote desktop sharing software so that technical support officers can provide timely help to the employee.\n5. Expenses and reimbursement\nYou should outline clearly in the work from home policy whether employees will be eligible for\nreimbursement\nof broadband and other utility expenses. If the company will not be reimbursing the employee for such expenses, you may wish to remind your employees that they may be able to claim a\npersonal income tax deduction\nagainst their employment income for charges such as electricity and telecommunication expenses that are not reimbursed by the company.\n6. Security and confidentiality\nOne of the key challenges in implementing work from home is ensuring company security and data confidentiality.\nTo address this issue, the work from home policy should outline proper guidelines on the treatment of confidential information by the employee, such as ensuring appropriate forms of protection inclusive of password protection, and fingerprint/voice recognition for access to the corporate network and data.\nThe policy should also include reminders on basic security protocol, such as refraining from using public Wi-Fi networks and logging off from the computer when the employee is away.\nIf the company assumes responsibility for providing the employee with adequate firewall and virus protection on their work computers, this should also be clearly stated in the policy.\n7. Performance evaluation\nTo ensure the productivity and accountability of your employees, you may consider including a section on performance evaluation.\nIn this section, you should clearly state key performance indicators on which the employee’s performance will be assessed. You may also wish to schedule regular reviews of job performance between supervisors and employees to ensure that everything is on track.\nEmployer Tips for Implementing a Work From Home Policy in Singapore\nYou should ensure that your employees fully understand the work from home policy and allow them to raise any questions they may have.\nThe terms of the policy should be on a digital portal (such as your company’s website) or drive that is easily accessible to employees, wherever they are working from. That way, both you and your employees will have a shared understanding of their responsibilities and expectations while working from home.\nWhile drafting the work from home policy, you may find it helpful to ask some of your long-term employees for their input on what would be a fair and reasonable work from policy for your company.\nAs a starting point, here is a draft\nHR Policy for Flexible Work Arrangements\nand a\nSample Telecommuting Agreement\nprovided by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. However, you should tailor these documents according to your company’s needs.\nAfter implementing the policy, you should also review it regularly to ensure that it stays relevant to the changing needs of your company and your employees. In this regard, you should regularly obtain feedback from employees who have made use of the policy, their supervisors, as well as in-office employees.\n—\nWe hope that the above has been useful in helping you understand whether you should implement a work from home policy for your company in Singapore and how you may go about doing so.\nIt is definitely possible to draft a work from home policy without assistance from a lawyer.

Covid-19 was also a main factor pushing many companies to implement work-from-home policies. Even though there is a greater push for back-to-office work now that Covid-19 is not a menace, work from home is here is stay.\nWhat is a Work From Home Policy?\nA work from home policy is a set of company guidelines allowing employees to work from home. These guidelines cover matters such as employees’ eligibility for working from home as well as the responsibilities and expectations of both employers and employees while working from home.\nFor avoidance of doubt, the terms “telecommuting” and “work from home” are generally used interchangeably.\nHowever, strictly speaking, work from home is a form of telecommuting, which generally refers to a flexible work arrangement that allows one to work outside of the office (flexi-place). Hence, it is possible for employees to work from any remote area, other than their homes, under a work from home policy.\nYour work from home arrangement also can either be stand-alone or part of a broader flexible work arrangement.\nIs It Compulsory for You to Implement Work From Home Arrangements?\nAs of now, all employers must have a process in place for workers to make formal requests for flexible work arrangements. Flexible work arrangements include “flexi-place”, for example work from home arrangements, “flexi-time” (working at different timings with no change in hours and workload), and “flexi-load” (different workloads with commensurate pay, for example part-time work). Employers are expected to consider such requests based on reasonable business grounds that are directly linked to business outcomes. Employers are also expected to give a formal answer to such requests.\nThis is based on the compulsory Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests and it is more of a baseline standard. Companies serious about having a work-from-home policy would have to make more detailed operational plans to facilitate it.\nShould You Implement Work From Home Arrangements?\nEven where work from home arrangements are not compulsory, the Ministry of Manpower still encourages their implementation due to the many benefits this can bring. These may include:\nAttraction and retention of employees:\nOffering the option to work from home may make you a more attractive employer as there may be employees who prefer working from home.\nGreater work-life balance for employees\n: Your employees may be able to enjoy a better\nwork-life balance\n. The decrease in commute time means that employees will be able to spend more time on their own pursuits. Those with young children or elderly parents will be able to better perform their family responsibilities because they can be home more often.\nIncreased productivity\n: For some employees, the elimination of office distractions, such as colleagues talking to each other, may also translate to greater productivity. The decrease in time spent on commuting also means that your employees will have more time to rest and recharge.\nSolution to manpower crunch\n: You will have access to a greater manpower base and talent pool. This is because you may have the option of employing those who are unable to commit to office-based work due to family responsibilities or other reasons.\nBetter preparedness for emergency situations\n: Implementing work from home arrangements will allow your company to quickly\ncommence business continuity plans\nduring times of crisis. This could be where your employees cannot work from the office as it has been destroyed by fire, for example. This way, your company will already have the infrastructure and experience required to efficiently execute such plans.\nHow to Write a Work From Home Policy in Singapore\nYou may find certain challenges when it comes to implementing work from home arrangements.\nFor example, there may be risks of miscommunication or threats to company security. It is therefore important to draft and implement a well-considered work from home policy to minimise the occurrence of such problems from the outset.\nBelow are some key terms that you may consider including in your company’s work from home policy:\n1. Eligibility\nThe policy should state which employees will be allowed to take advantage of such a policy. For example, it may be appropriate to include employees in charge of backend processes, but not employees in charge of office reception who need to manage visitors in person.\nOn this note, you may wish to list in the policy the factors that will be considered in deciding whether to grant an employee’s work from home request.\nFor example, one additional factor could be the suitability of the employee to work from home. Some employees may be better able to maintain good communication with their colleagues while working from home, while others may not.\nWork days\nThe policy should also clearly state when and how often employees will be allowed to work from home. For example, you may offer certain fixed “work from home days” in the week. If you do so, you should state in the policy whether employees can request to work in the office on their work from home days.\nAlternatively, you may allow your employees to request to work from home when they need to do so. If so, you should provide examples of when your employees may submit an ad hoc work from home request. For example, some acceptable reasons may include:\nParenting/eldercare responsibilities\nMedical appointments\nHome emergencies\nMental health requirements\nYou should make it clear whether providing one of the accepted reasons listed in the request will result in guaranteed approval, or whether the request will still be subject to approval (more below).\nIf you wish to exclude certain days or periods in the year in which working from home is not permissible, you should also state so explicitly in your policy to prevent any misunderstandings. For example, you may require your employees to be in office when there will be an all-hands meeting.\n2. Request/approval process\nThe policy should clearly lay out the process of making requests to work from home. You should consider what sort of process would suit your company.\nFor instance, should employees make a formal request to HR, or do they have to obtain the approval of their supervisor? You may also wish to state whether employees must declare their place of work, or they may work at any location they like.\nIn this regard, the above-mentioned\nTripartite Standard on Flexible Work Arrangements (TSFWA)\noffers some guidance.\nAccording to the TSFWA, you should train supervisors to objectively evaluate employees’ applications for working from home. You should also aim to communicate the outcomes of work from home applications in a timely manner.\nIf you are unable to grant a work from home request, the TSFWA recommends that you explain to employees the reasons why and where possible, discuss suitable alternatives.\nFor example, if they requested for an arrangement to work from home, but are needed on-site on a particular day, you could grant them an extra day of work from home the following week.\n3. Expectations and responsibilities\nThe work from home policy should include any standards that will be expected of the employee.\nFor example, if the employee will have to communicate with clients or business partners through video-conferencing tools while working from home, it may be helpful to include a term on the expected dress code for such meetings.\nFor jobs that require a high degree of confidentiality, it might make sense to include a term stating that the employee should work only at home, as opposed to external venues such as cafes and libraries.\nThis would help prevent breaches of confidentiality arising from, for example, others viewing the employee’s computer screen or overhearing confidential conversations, or the employee connecting to unsecure public Wi-Fi networks.\nCommunication\nAnother term that should be included is the expected response time of the employee. You should set out clearly whether the employee must always be contactable, or whether it would be sufficient for him or her to check his or her messages every hour or so.\nYou should also state the preferred mode of communication, be it through email, text or call. Lastly, you may also wish to state how frequently the employee will need to report his or her progress to the manager.\nBy laying out these expectations clearly, misunderstandings can be minimised and the employee can also be kept accountable.\n4. Equipment and technical support\nProper equipment is crucial for your employees to work productively from home. Your policy should state whether the company will be providing the employee with necessary equipment such as laptops or mobile phones.\nIf that is not feasible, you may wish to provide your employee with remote desktop software so that he or she can access his or her work desktop from his or her home computer.\nAdditionally, the policy should outline the procedure in case the employee experiences technical difficulties while working from home. For example, how would the technical support team extend help to the employee, and how would the employee be expected to respond to work emergencies?\nIn this regard, you may also wish to invest in remote desktop sharing software so that technical support officers can provide timely help to the employee.\n5. Expenses and reimbursement\nYou should outline clearly in the work from home policy whether employees will be eligible for\nreimbursement\nof broadband and other utility expenses. If the company will not be reimbursing the employee for such expenses, you may wish to remind your employees that they may be able to claim a\npersonal income tax deduction\nagainst their employment income for charges such as electricity and telecommunication expenses that are not reimbursed by the company.\n6. Security and confidentiality\nOne of the key challenges in implementing work from home is ensuring company security and data confidentiality.\nTo address this issue, the work from home policy should outline proper guidelines on the treatment of confidential information by the employee, such as ensuring appropriate forms of protection inclusive of password protection, and fingerprint/voice recognition for access to the corporate network and data.\nThe policy should also include reminders on basic security protocol, such as refraining from using public Wi-Fi networks and logging off from the computer when the employee is away.\nIf the company assumes responsibility for providing the employee with adequate firewall and virus protection on their work computers, this should also be clearly stated in the policy.\n7. Performance evaluation\nTo ensure the productivity and accountability of your employees, you may consider including a section on performance evaluation.\nIn this section, you should clearly state key performance indicators on which the employee’s performance will be assessed. You may also wish to schedule regular reviews of job performance between supervisors and employees to ensure that everything is on track.\nEmployer Tips for Implementing a Work From Home Policy in Singapore\nYou should ensure that your employees fully understand the work from home policy and allow them to raise any questions they may have.\nThe terms of the policy should be on a digital portal (such as your company’s website) or drive that is easily accessible to employees, wherever they are working from.

However, making sense of ESOPs can be a rather complex affair.\nThis article will introduce you to ESOPs and explain what exactly ESOPs entail so that you are better informed.\nWhat is an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)?\nAn ESOP gives employees the\nright to purchase shares\nin the company at a specific pre-determined price, within a certain set time-frame.\nWhat makes ESOPs particularly advantageous for attracting and retaining talent is the\nsense of ownership\nit confers on employees, and the\nstrong incentive for their longer-term commitment\nto the company.\nGiving employees a slice of the pie means that they stand to benefit directly from an increase in the value of the company, which may provide a strong motivating factor for them to work hard and commit to the company for the long-haul.\nBy designating a certain period of time before employees are able to exercise their right to purchase the shares allocated to them, ESOPs may also further incentivise employees to commit long-term in order to take advantage of their share options.\nFor smaller companies, ESOPs provide another means of compensation if they are unable to offer a large paycheck to their employees.\nConversely, ESOPs may offer limited benefits for newer employees.\nSince the number of shares given to an employee would depend on how long the employee has been with the company, more shares may be allocated to senior employees. This, in turn, may grant them higher voting power than newer hires, constraining opportunities for newer employees to participate in decision-making.\nAs a result, new employees may not gain an equally strong sense of ownership in the company, but feel alienated from the employees enjoying their senior rank benefits, and the effectiveness of your ESOP as a tool for retaining talent may be adversely affected.\nThe following should be kept in mind before preparing an ESOP:\nESOP Pros\nESOP Cons\nMotivating factor for employees to commit longer to the company.\nNew employees have lesser opportunities in decision-making and may lose their sense of company ownership, resulting in possible challenges in the company’s ability to retain talent.\nSmall companies that are unable to pay salary may compensate employees through ESOPs.\nESOP vs Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOW)\nAn ESOP is essentially a type of Employee Share Ownership (ESOW).\nAn ESOW plan refers to any plan that allows an employee of a company to own or purchase shares in the company or in its parent company. ESOWs also usually exclude phantom shares and share appreciation rights.\nPhantom shares are essentially promises to pay a bonus in the form of either cash or equity that is equal in the value of company shares, or the increase in that value, over a stipulated time period.\nOn the other hand, share appreciation rights are similar to phantom shares, but also give employees the right to a cash equivalent of the increase in value of a predetermined number of shares, over a designated period of time.\nAs for ESOP plans, they are a specific type of ESOW that gives employees rights to purchase shares in the company\nat a pre-determined price within a specific time-frame\n.\nHow Can an ESOP be Structured?\nAn ESOP can be structured by an ESOP Agreement that creates an Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP Pool) that sets aside a percentage of equity shareholding for employees. Employees can participate in the shares of the company via this pool of shares.\nAn ESOP Agreement will include the details of members of an\nESOP\ncommittee\n. Such a committee typically includes\ndirectors\nand other officers in the company, and is responsible for managing the ESOP Pool and recommend relevant actions to the company’s Board of Directors.\nAn ESOP may also include a\nCliff\nand/or\nVest\nperiod. These periods have different implications on whether an employee receives stock options or not.\nIf an employee leaves the company during the\nCliff\nperiod of an ESOP, he/she will not receive any stock options.\nOn the other hand, the\nVest\nperiod refers to the period of time before shares in an ESOP are unconditionally owned by the employee. If an employee leaves during the Vest period, which usually succeeds the Cliff period, he/she will be given pro-rated stock options based on the length of time they have stayed with the company.\nAdditionally, an ESOP may also include a\nselling restriction\n, or a time period within which an employee may not sell his or her shares.\nFor example, instead of allowing an employee to exercise all 10,000 of his/her shares after a fixed time period, your ESOP may instead restrict him/her to exercising only 2,000 shares at 6-month intervals.\nHow an ESOP may be structured would depend on your company’s financial health, needs and objectives. Below are some guiding questions to help you determine the structure of your company’s ESOP:\nHow much should your employee be paid, according to market standards?\nHow much of your employee’s salary can you pay in cash?\nHow long do you need to compensate for the gap between your employee’s cash salary and his/her full market salary?\nHow much should you value your stock options at?\nHow many stock options should you grant?\nHere is an example to illustrate the features of a\ncliff\nperiod\n, vest\nperiod and\nselling restriction\n:\nMax is hired by company A and is given 30,000 shares as part of his employment package. These options are subject to a 2-year cliff so, Max must remain employed by company A for 2 years before he is able to exercise his stock options.\nThe options are also subject to a 3-year vest, and Max can purchase the shares granted to him at a rate of 20 cents per share.\nDuring the vesting period, a designated portion of Max’s shares become exercisable after each year in the vesting period. Because his share options are subject to a 3-year vest, Max is restricted to only exercising 10,000 shares for each year in the 3-year vesting period.\nAt the end of the vesting period, all of Max’s shares will become exercisable.\nIn addition, when Max’s shares become exercisable, or vested, he has the option to then purchase his shares at 20 cents per share as per the terms of the ESOP. This is even if the share price has already increased significantly relative to the price agreed upon in the employment package.\nHence, Max buys his shares at 20 cents per share even though their present value is now 60 cents per share.\nWhat are Some Important Terms in an ESOP?\nWhile ESOPs vary between individual companies, every good ESOP should include the following:\nWho is eligible for the ESOP i.e. a set of\neligibility criteria\nto qualify or disqualify certain employees from taking part in the ESOP.\nA\ntime period and/or a set of conditions\nstipulating when the ESOP is granted. Granting means giving your employees the option to purchase your company’s shares.\nClearly defined presence or absence of a\nvesting period.\nWho is in the\nESOP committee\n, and what the functions of the ESOP committee are.\nNumber of\nESOP shares\nissued.\nAre There Any Tax Implications on Employers?\nA company is granted tax deductions on any costs incurred to acquire its own shares, so as to transfer these shares to employees under the ESOP. This is provided that the ESOP granted to the employee falls under the\nQualified Employee Equity-Based Remuneration Scheme (QEEBR)\n(discussed below).\nWhat About the Tax Implications on Employees?\nAn employee who is given share options via an ESOP will be taxed on any gains arising from the exercise of the share option.\nHow the gains from the exercise of the share option will be taxed depends on when the share option was granted. For example, gains from an ESOP with no vest period are taxable the year when the shares are granted.\nFor gains from ESOPs with a vesting period, these are taxable in the year when the ESOP is exercised if there is no selling restriction. If such a selling restriction is present, then gains from the ESOP will be taxed only in the year when the selling restriction is lifted.\nUnder the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)’\nQEEBR\n, tax on gains from share options derived from an ESOP can be deferred up to a maximum of 5 years, subject to an interest charge.\nFor an ESOP to qualify for tax deferment under the QEEBR, the following conditions must be met:\nIf the exercise price of the option is equal to or more than the open market price at the time of being granted, the ESOP cannot be exercisable within a year from the grant of the option. If the exercise price of the option is less than the open market price, then this vesting period requirement goes up to 2 years. If a company is not a listed company, the company’s net asset value (i.e. the difference between the company’s assets and liabilities) will be used in place of the open market price.\nIf your ESOP has a staggered vesting period, only the proportion of shares that have not vested may qualify for tax deferment. For example, if only 40% of an employee’s share options have vested so far, then the remaining 60% of the share options will qualify for tax deferment.\nThe employee must still be employed in Singapore at the time of the grant of the ESOP, as opposed to the time of exercise of the ESOP. That means that an ESOP qualifies if the employee receives the share options while working in Singapore.\nThe employee who is granted an ESOP is not an undischarged\nbankrupt\n, does not possess a poor tax-paying record, has tax on stock options gains more than $200, has not been granted area representative status, and is allowed to settle tax by instalments under current tax rules.\nAn employee is not granted representative status if he/she falls within any one of the following:\nEmployed by an employer resident in Singapore\nNot based in Singapore\nNot required to travel outside of Singapore\nThe employee’s remuneration is charged directly, or indirectly, to the accounts of a permanent establishment in Singapore from which business is conducted, such as an office or factory.\nAs an employer, you will not need to apply to IRAS for approval to have such plans considered as qualified ESOP or ESOW plans.\nHowever, you will be required to keep proper records to prove that your ESOP meets the vesting period requirement, and certify on your employee’s application form for tax deferral that your company’s ESOP qualifies for tax deferment.\n—\nESOPs are powerful incentives for keeping talented employees, and every company, regardless of size or industry, should consider introducing one.\nHowever, how an ESOP may be structured — from the duration and nature of the vesting period to how large the employee options pool should be — can be difficult to figure out, and you may wish to consult a lawyer on this beforehand.

However, making sense of ESOPs can be a rather complex affair.\nThis article will introduce you to ESOPs and explain what exactly ESOPs entail so that you are better informed.\nWhat is an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)?\nAn ESOP gives employees the\nright to purchase shares\nin the company at a specific pre-determined price, within a certain set time-frame.\nWhat makes ESOPs particularly advantageous for attracting and retaining talent is the\nsense of ownership\nit confers on employees, and the\nstrong incentive for their longer-term commitment\nto the company.\nGiving employees a slice of the pie means that they stand to benefit directly from an increase in the value of the company, which may provide a strong motivating factor for them to work hard and commit to the company for the long-haul.\nBy designating a certain period of time before employees are able to exercise their right to purchase the shares allocated to them, ESOPs may also further incentivise employees to commit long-term in order to take advantage of their share options.\nFor smaller companies, ESOPs provide another means of compensation if they are unable to offer a large paycheck to their employees.\nConversely, ESOPs may offer limited benefits for newer employees.\nSince the number of shares given to an employee would depend on how long the employee has been with the company, more shares may be allocated to senior employees. This, in turn, may grant them higher voting power than newer hires, constraining opportunities for newer employees to participate in decision-making.\nAs a result, new employees may not gain an equally strong sense of ownership in the company, but feel alienated from the employees enjoying their senior rank benefits, and the effectiveness of your ESOP as a tool for retaining talent may be adversely affected.\nThe following should be kept in mind before preparing an ESOP:\nESOP Pros\nESOP Cons\nMotivating factor for employees to commit longer to the company.\nNew employees have lesser opportunities in decision-making and may lose their sense of company ownership, resulting in possible challenges in the company’s ability to retain talent.\nSmall companies that are unable to pay salary may compensate employees through ESOPs.\nESOP vs Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOW)\nAn ESOP is essentially a type of Employee Share Ownership (ESOW).\nAn ESOW plan refers to any plan that allows an employee of a company to own or purchase shares in the company or in its parent company. ESOWs also usually exclude phantom shares and share appreciation rights.\nPhantom shares are essentially promises to pay a bonus in the form of either cash or equity that is equal in the value of company shares, or the increase in that value, over a stipulated time period.\nOn the other hand, share appreciation rights are similar to phantom shares, but also give employees the right to a cash equivalent of the increase in value of a predetermined number of shares, over a designated period of time.\nAs for ESOP plans, they are a specific type of ESOW that gives employees rights to purchase shares in the company\nat a pre-determined price within a specific time-frame\n.\nHow Can an ESOP be Structured?\nAn ESOP can be structured by an ESOP Agreement that creates an Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP Pool) that sets aside a percentage of equity shareholding for employees. Employees can participate in the shares of the company via this pool of shares.\nAn ESOP Agreement will include the details of members of an\nESOP\ncommittee\n. Such a committee typically includes\ndirectors\nand other officers in the company, and is responsible for managing the ESOP Pool and recommend relevant actions to the company’s Board of Directors.\nAn ESOP may also include a\nCliff\nand/or\nVest\nperiod. These periods have different implications on whether an employee receives stock options or not.\nIf an employee leaves the company during the\nCliff\nperiod of an ESOP, he/she will not receive any stock options.\nOn the other hand, the\nVest\nperiod refers to the period of time before shares in an ESOP are unconditionally owned by the employee. If an employee leaves during the Vest period, which usually succeeds the Cliff period, he/she will be given pro-rated stock options based on the length of time they have stayed with the company.\nAdditionally, an ESOP may also include a\nselling restriction\n, or a time period within which an employee may not sell his or her shares.\nFor example, instead of allowing an employee to exercise all 10,000 of his/her shares after a fixed time period, your ESOP may instead restrict him/her to exercising only 2,000 shares at 6-month intervals.\nHow an ESOP may be structured would depend on your company’s financial health, needs and objectives. Below are some guiding questions to help you determine the structure of your company’s ESOP:\nHow much should your employee be paid, according to market standards?\nHow much of your employee’s salary can you pay in cash?\nHow long do you need to compensate for the gap between your employee’s cash salary and his/her full market salary?\nHow much should you value your stock options at?\nHow many stock options should you grant?\nHere is an example to illustrate the features of a\ncliff\nperiod\n, vest\nperiod and\nselling restriction\n:\nMax is hired by company A and is given 30,000 shares as part of his employment package. These options are subject to a 2-year cliff so, Max must remain employed by company A for 2 years before he is able to exercise his stock options.\nThe options are also subject to a 3-year vest, and Max can purchase the shares granted to him at a rate of 20 cents per share.\nDuring the vesting period, a designated portion of Max’s shares become exercisable after each year in the vesting period. Because his share options are subject to a 3-year vest, Max is restricted to only exercising 10,000 shares for each year in the 3-year vesting period.\nAt the end of the vesting period, all of Max’s shares will become exercisable.\nIn addition, when Max’s shares become exercisable, or vested, he has the option to then purchase his shares at 20 cents per share as per the terms of the ESOP. This is even if the share price has already increased significantly relative to the price agreed upon in the employment package.\nHence, Max buys his shares at 20 cents per share even though their present value is now 60 cents per share.\nWhat are Some Important Terms in an ESOP?\nWhile ESOPs vary between individual companies, every good ESOP should include the following:\nWho is eligible for the ESOP i.e. a set of\neligibility criteria\nto qualify or disqualify certain employees from taking part in the ESOP.\nA\ntime period and/or a set of conditions\nstipulating when the ESOP is granted. Granting means giving your employees the option to purchase your company’s shares.\nClearly defined presence or absence of a\nvesting period.\nWho is in the\nESOP committee\n, and what the functions of the ESOP committee are.\nNumber of\nESOP shares\nissued.\nAre There Any Tax Implications on Employers?\nA company is granted tax deductions on any costs incurred to acquire its own shares, so as to transfer these shares to employees under the ESOP. This is provided that the ESOP granted to the employee falls under the\nQualified Employee Equity-Based Remuneration Scheme (QEEBR)\n(discussed below).\nWhat About the Tax Implications on Employees?\nAn employee who is given share options via an ESOP will be taxed on any gains arising from the exercise of the share option.\nHow the gains from the exercise of the share option will be taxed depends on when the share option was granted. For example, gains from an ESOP with no vest period are taxable the year when the shares are granted.\nFor gains from ESOPs with a vesting period, these are taxable in the year when the ESOP is exercised if there is no selling restriction. If such a selling restriction is present, then gains from the ESOP will be taxed only in the year when the selling restriction is lifted.\nUnder the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS)’\nQEEBR\n, tax on gains from share options derived from an ESOP can be deferred up to a maximum of 5 years, subject to an interest charge.\nFor an ESOP to qualify for tax deferment under the QEEBR, the following conditions must be met:\nIf the exercise price of the option is equal to or more than the open market price at the time of being granted, the ESOP cannot be exercisable within a year from the grant of the option. If the exercise price of the option is less than the open market price, then this vesting period requirement goes up to 2 years. If a company is not a listed company, the company’s net asset value (i.e. the difference between the company’s assets and liabilities) will be used in place of the open market price.\nIf your ESOP has a staggered vesting period, only the proportion of shares that have not vested may qualify for tax deferment. For example, if only 40% of an employee’s share options have vested so far, then the remaining 60% of the share options will qualify for tax deferment.\nThe employee must still be employed in Singapore at the time of the grant of the ESOP, as opposed to the time of exercise of the ESOP. That means that an ESOP qualifies if the employee receives the share options while working in Singapore.\nThe employee who is granted an ESOP is not an undischarged\nbankrupt\n, does not possess a poor tax-paying record, has tax on stock options gains more than $200, has not been granted area representative status, and is allowed to settle tax by instalments under current tax rules.\nAn employee is not granted representative status if he/she falls within any one of the following:\nEmployed by an employer resident in Singapore\nNot based in Singapore\nNot required to travel outside of Singapore\nThe employee’s remuneration is charged directly, or indirectly, to the accounts of a permanent establishment in Singapore from which business is conducted, such as an office or factory.\nAs an employer, you will not need to apply to IRAS for approval to have such plans considered as qualified ESOP or ESOW plans.\nHowever, you will be required to keep proper records to prove that your ESOP meets the vesting period requirement, and certify on your employee’s application form for tax deferral that your company’s ESOP qualifies for tax deferment.\n—\nESOPs are powerful incentives for keeping talented employees, and every company, regardless of size or industry, should consider introducing one.\nHowever, how an ESOP may be structured — from the duration and nature of the vesting period to how large the employee options pool should be — can be difficult to figure out, and you may wish to consult a lawyer on this beforehand.

You may retire at an earlier age if you wish.\nCan my employer dismiss me on the ground of age before I’ve reached the retirement age?\nUnder section 4(2) of the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA), an employer is not allowed to dismiss an employee who is younger than the minimum retirement age of 63 years old on the ground of age.\nEmployers who do so can be found guilty of an offence and liable to a fine up to S$5,000 and/or a term of imprisonment of up to 6 months. See below for more information on what to do if you have a dispute with your employer over dismissal due to age.\nAm I allowed to continue working after reaching the retirement age?\nYou are allowed to continue working after reaching the retirement age as long as you are willing and able to do so.\nAlso, before you turn 63, your employer must offer you re-employment in your current organisation if you meet the eligibility criteria for re-employment, as outlined below.\nRe-Employment after Reaching the Retirement\nAge\nWhat is re-employment?\nRe-employment refers to the re-contracting of employees who have reached the retirement age, to allow them to continue working if they are willing and able to. This is done by offering such employees a re-employment contract.\nWhat is the re-employment age in Singapore?\nAs of 1 July 2022, the re-employment age (i.e. the maximum age an employee can be re-employed until) is\n68 years old\n. This means that employers must offer, to eligible employees who turn 63, re-employment until the age of 68.\nWho is eligible for re-employment?\nIn order to be eligible for re-employment, you must satisfy the following criteria:\nBe a Singapore citizen or Singapore permanent resident;\nHave worked with your current employer for at least 2 years before turning 63 (if you were hired at the age of 55 or older);\nYour employer has assessed your work performance to be satisfactory;\nYou are medically fit (i.e. mentally and physically able to continue working); and\nYou are born on or after 1 July 1952.\nHowever, the following categories of employees are exempted from re-employment:\nPublic officers serving in the police, prisons, narcotics, civil defence, and corrupt practices investigation service;\nPersons enlisted for regular service with the Singapore Armed Forces;\nAuxiliary police officers;\nPublic officers and statutory board employees who are eligible for benefits under the Pensions Act;\nCabin crew from commercial aircrafts;\nEmployees who work 20 hours or less per week;\nEmployees on fixed term contracts for specific projects, where employment is expected to cease when the project ends; and\nEmployees who were first employed after 55 years of age and have worked with the company for fewer than 2 years.\nIf you are not eligible for re-employment, your employer should inform you of this at least 3 months before you turn 63 to give you time to look for a new job opportunity.\nIn addition, employers are encouraged to help older employees who are not eligible for re-employment in their job search by offering services such as career counselling.\nIs re-employment for everyone? What if I do not wish to be re-employed?\nRe-employment allows you, as an employee, the option to decide if you wish or need to work longer. You are not required or compelled to continue working or be re-employed after reaching the retirement age, even if you are eligible to.\nIf you decide that you do not wish to be re-employed once you reach the retirement age, you may inform your employer of your decision upon receiving the offer of re-employment. Your employer may then require you to confirm your decision in writing.\nIf you accept an offer of re-employment and subsequently decide that you do not wish to continue working, you can exercise normal\ntermination\nand serve notice in accordance with the terms of your re-employment contract.\nCan I still work after the maximum re-employment age of 68 years?\nThere is no legal provision in Singapore that prohibits you from working after the maximum re-employment age of 68 years. This is so long as you are medically fit and willing to work, and your current organisation can accommodate such an arrangement.\nUnderstanding\nthe Offer of Re-Employment\nRe-employment is usually offered through a contract.\nYour employer should consult and begin discussions about your re-employment with you at least 6 months in advance of your 63rd birthday. Your employer should also offer you the re-employment contract at least 3 months prior to your birthday. (These timelines also apply to any subsequent re-employment contracts offered for renewal.)\nDuring the re-employment discussions, employees and their employers can work out mutually beneficial and/or flexible arrangements in their organisations. The re-employment terms, including the job position, working hours and salary, may also be re-adjusted.\nIf you are agreeable to the re-employment terms in your contract, your re-employment contract will take effect on the same day you turn 63. This means that if you turn 63 on 1 March 2023, your re-employment period will commence on 1 March 2023 as well.\nAccording to the\nTripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees\n, your re-employment contract should be for a period of at least 1 year, with subsequent re-employment contracts being renewable every year up to the maximum retirement age of 68 years. Apart from renewable 1-year contracts, it is also possible for your employer to offer a 5-year fixed-term contract up to the retirement age of 68 years.\nShould your employer not approach you to discuss re-employment arrangements, and you do not indicate your wish to retire or to not be re-employed, it will be assumed that:\nYou will continue working in the same job after you turn 63 years of age, and\nYou will be entitled to the same terms and benefits as stated in your initial contract of employment.\nWhat Can My Employer Do If They are Unable to Offer Me Re-Employment Despite My Eligibility?\n1. Transfer re-employment obligations to another employer\nIt may be the case that your employer may be unable to offer you re-employment if, despite reasonable efforts, there is no suitable or available job vacancy in your current organisation.\nIn these circumstances, it is possible for your employer to transfer their re-employment obligations to another employer. If so, the following conditions must be met:\nThe new employer must agree to the transfer of your employer’s re-employment obligations; and\nYou must agree to the offer of re-employment by the new employer.\nYou, as well as your current employer and new employer, will be required to complete a consent form to reflect this agreement for re-employment. A sample of the consent form is available\nhere\n.\nHowever, you are not obliged to accept the new employer’s offer of re-employment.\n2. Offer an\nEmployment Assistance Payment (EAP)\nThe EAP is a one-off payment offered by your current employer as a last resort if they are unable to offer you re-employment within the organisation, after considering all available options. For example, if your employer has considered re-deploying you to a different job but there is no vacancy.\nThis sum of money is intended as a form of financial support while you search for other employment opportunities. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) recommends that the payment provided should be equivalent to 3.5 months’ salary, with a minimum amount of S$6,250 and a maximum of S$14,750.\nYou will not be entitled to an EAP if you:\nMutually agree with your employer that you will not receive it,\nDecline an offer of re-employment from your\ncurrent\nemployer, or\nAre not eligible for re-employment.\nHowever if your employer has helped you obtain another job with a new employer, you are still eligible for the EAP even if you choose to turn down the offer.\nResolving Re-Employment Disputes with Your Employer\nDisputes with your employer may arise in the following circumstances:\nThere are disagreements in negotiating the terms of your re-employment contract\nYou have not been offered re-employment and/or you disagree with your employer’s reasons for it\nYou find the EAP amount to be unreasonable\nYou have been unfairly dismissed due to your age\nAs far as possible, you should try to resolve any disputes with your employer in an amicable manner or seek assistance from your union, if applicable.\nOtherwise, you may wish to approach MOM or the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM).\nDo note that you may be asked for the following when approaching either organisation for assistance:\nDetails of your dispute with your employer\nRelevant supporting documents, e.g. your re-employment contract\nSeeking assistance from MOM\nIf you are covered by the RRA (i.e. you are a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and joined the organisation or were recruited before the age of 55), you can seek assistance from MOM if you believe you have been wrongfully dismissed due to your age. If you are not covered by the RRA, you may wish to seek assistance from the TADM (see below).\nTo seek assistance from MOM, you will need to complete\nthis online appeal form\nwithin 1 month from your last day of employment.\nIf your appeal is successful and the Minister for Manpower is satisfied that you were wrongfully dismissed, your employer may be ordered to:\nReinstate you to your former job and compensate you for the loss of income during the period of dismissal; or\nPay you a sum of money as compensation.\nSeeking assistance from the TADM\nThe TADM offers advisory and mediation services. It seeks to resolve employment or payment-related disputes involving employees not covered by the RRA, in an amicable manner, without the need to undergo legal proceedings. Appointments to consult a TADM advisor can be made\nonline\n.\nYou can also find out the most suitable option for resolving your dispute through TADM by answering a few questions\nhere\n. You will then be directed to the appropriate avenues to take up your matter accordingly and/or the amount you will be able to claim.\n—\nAs an older employee, you should try to begin discussions with your employer about your re-employment as early as 6 months before you turn 63. This will allow you to better negotiate the terms of your re-employment contract to ensure they are fair and reasonable.\nYou can also take steps to better prepare yourself for re-employment by informing your employer about your job preferences as soon as possible. You should also be flexible in negotiating your re-employment arrangements and contractual terms, so that you can continue to be able to contribute to your organisation during your period of re-employment.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

See below for more information on what to do if you have a dispute with your employer over dismissal due to age.\nAm I allowed to continue working after reaching the retirement age?\nYou are allowed to continue working after reaching the retirement age as long as you are willing and able to do so.\nAlso, before you turn 63, your employer must offer you re-employment in your current organisation if you meet the eligibility criteria for re-employment, as outlined below.\nRe-Employment after Reaching the Retirement\nAge\nWhat is re-employment?\nRe-employment refers to the re-contracting of employees who have reached the retirement age, to allow them to continue working if they are willing and able to. This is done by offering such employees a re-employment contract.\nWhat is the re-employment age in Singapore?\nAs of 1 July 2022, the re-employment age (i.e. the maximum age an employee can be re-employed until) is\n68 years old\n. This means that employers must offer, to eligible employees who turn 63, re-employment until the age of 68.\nWho is eligible for re-employment?\nIn order to be eligible for re-employment, you must satisfy the following criteria:\nBe a Singapore citizen or Singapore permanent resident;\nHave worked with your current employer for at least 2 years before turning 63 (if you were hired at the age of 55 or older);\nYour employer has assessed your work performance to be satisfactory;\nYou are medically fit (i.e. mentally and physically able to continue working); and\nYou are born on or after 1 July 1952.\nHowever, the following categories of employees are exempted from re-employment:\nPublic officers serving in the police, prisons, narcotics, civil defence, and corrupt practices investigation service;\nPersons enlisted for regular service with the Singapore Armed Forces;\nAuxiliary police officers;\nPublic officers and statutory board employees who are eligible for benefits under the Pensions Act;\nCabin crew from commercial aircrafts;\nEmployees who work 20 hours or less per week;\nEmployees on fixed term contracts for specific projects, where employment is expected to cease when the project ends; and\nEmployees who were first employed after 55 years of age and have worked with the company for fewer than 2 years.\nIf you are not eligible for re-employment, your employer should inform you of this at least 3 months before you turn 63 to give you time to look for a new job opportunity.\nIn addition, employers are encouraged to help older employees who are not eligible for re-employment in their job search by offering services such as career counselling.\nIs re-employment for everyone? What if I do not wish to be re-employed?\nRe-employment allows you, as an employee, the option to decide if you wish or need to work longer. You are not required or compelled to continue working or be re-employed after reaching the retirement age, even if you are eligible to.\nIf you decide that you do not wish to be re-employed once you reach the retirement age, you may inform your employer of your decision upon receiving the offer of re-employment. Your employer may then require you to confirm your decision in writing.\nIf you accept an offer of re-employment and subsequently decide that you do not wish to continue working, you can exercise normal\ntermination\nand serve notice in accordance with the terms of your re-employment contract.\nCan I still work after the maximum re-employment age of 68 years?\nThere is no legal provision in Singapore that prohibits you from working after the maximum re-employment age of 68 years. This is so long as you are medically fit and willing to work, and your current organisation can accommodate such an arrangement.\nUnderstanding\nthe Offer of Re-Employment\nRe-employment is usually offered through a contract.\nYour employer should consult and begin discussions about your re-employment with you at least 6 months in advance of your 63rd birthday. Your employer should also offer you the re-employment contract at least 3 months prior to your birthday. (These timelines also apply to any subsequent re-employment contracts offered for renewal.)\nDuring the re-employment discussions, employees and their employers can work out mutually beneficial and/or flexible arrangements in their organisations. The re-employment terms, including the job position, working hours and salary, may also be re-adjusted.\nIf you are agreeable to the re-employment terms in your contract, your re-employment contract will take effect on the same day you turn 63. This means that if you turn 63 on 1 March 2023, your re-employment period will commence on 1 March 2023 as well.\nAccording to the\nTripartite Guidelines on the Re-employment of Older Employees\n, your re-employment contract should be for a period of at least 1 year, with subsequent re-employment contracts being renewable every year up to the maximum retirement age of 68 years. Apart from renewable 1-year contracts, it is also possible for your employer to offer a 5-year fixed-term contract up to the retirement age of 68 years.\nShould your employer not approach you to discuss re-employment arrangements, and you do not indicate your wish to retire or to not be re-employed, it will be assumed that:\nYou will continue working in the same job after you turn 63 years of age, and\nYou will be entitled to the same terms and benefits as stated in your initial contract of employment.\nWhat Can My Employer Do If They are Unable to Offer Me Re-Employment Despite My Eligibility?\n1. Transfer re-employment obligations to another employer\nIt may be the case that your employer may be unable to offer you re-employment if, despite reasonable efforts, there is no suitable or available job vacancy in your current organisation.\nIn these circumstances, it is possible for your employer to transfer their re-employment obligations to another employer. If so, the following conditions must be met:\nThe new employer must agree to the transfer of your employer’s re-employment obligations; and\nYou must agree to the offer of re-employment by the new employer.\nYou, as well as your current employer and new employer, will be required to complete a consent form to reflect this agreement for re-employment. A sample of the consent form is available\nhere\n.\nHowever, you are not obliged to accept the new employer’s offer of re-employment.\n2. Offer an\nEmployment Assistance Payment (EAP)\nThe EAP is a one-off payment offered by your current employer as a last resort if they are unable to offer you re-employment within the organisation, after considering all available options. For example, if your employer has considered re-deploying you to a different job but there is no vacancy.\nThis sum of money is intended as a form of financial support while you search for other employment opportunities. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) recommends that the payment provided should be equivalent to 3.5 months’ salary, with a minimum amount of S$6,250 and a maximum of S$14,750.\nYou will not be entitled to an EAP if you:\nMutually agree with your employer that you will not receive it,\nDecline an offer of re-employment from your\ncurrent\nemployer, or\nAre not eligible for re-employment.\nHowever if your employer has helped you obtain another job with a new employer, you are still eligible for the EAP even if you choose to turn down the offer.\nResolving Re-Employment Disputes with Your Employer\nDisputes with your employer may arise in the following circumstances:\nThere are disagreements in negotiating the terms of your re-employment contract\nYou have not been offered re-employment and/or you disagree with your employer’s reasons for it\nYou find the EAP amount to be unreasonable\nYou have been unfairly dismissed due to your age\nAs far as possible, you should try to resolve any disputes with your employer in an amicable manner or seek assistance from your union, if applicable.\nOtherwise, you may wish to approach MOM or the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM).\nDo note that you may be asked for the following when approaching either organisation for assistance:\nDetails of your dispute with your employer\nRelevant supporting documents, e.g. your re-employment contract\nSeeking assistance from MOM\nIf you are covered by the RRA (i.e. you are a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and joined the organisation or were recruited before the age of 55), you can seek assistance from MOM if you believe you have been wrongfully dismissed due to your age. If you are not covered by the RRA, you may wish to seek assistance from the TADM (see below).\nTo seek assistance from MOM, you will need to complete\nthis online appeal form\nwithin 1 month from your last day of employment.\nIf your appeal is successful and the Minister for Manpower is satisfied that you were wrongfully dismissed, your employer may be ordered to:\nReinstate you to your former job and compensate you for the loss of income during the period of dismissal; or\nPay you a sum of money as compensation.\nSeeking assistance from the TADM\nThe TADM offers advisory and mediation services. It seeks to resolve employment or payment-related disputes involving employees not covered by the RRA, in an amicable manner, without the need to undergo legal proceedings. Appointments to consult a TADM advisor can be made\nonline\n.\nYou can also find out the most suitable option for resolving your dispute through TADM by answering a few questions\nhere\n. You will then be directed to the appropriate avenues to take up your matter accordingly and/or the amount you will be able to claim.\n—\nAs an older employee, you should try to begin discussions with your employer about your re-employment as early as 6 months before you turn 63. This will allow you to better negotiate the terms of your re-employment contract to ensure they are fair and reasonable.\nYou can also take steps to better prepare yourself for re-employment by informing your employer about your job preferences as soon as possible. You should also be flexible in negotiating your re-employment arrangements and contractual terms, so that you can continue to be able to contribute to your organisation during your period of re-employment.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

{"chunk_id": "SLA_21001ef2", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "FAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employer Obligations > FAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers", "text": "FAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nLast updated on January 5, 2026\nThe introduction of the Platform Workers Act (the Act) on 1 January 2025 marks a significant step in recognising the unique position of platform workers in the Singapore labour market.\nThe Act aims to better protect platform workers’ rights by plugging existing gaps, while ensuring they maintain their independent status as platform workers in a gig economy. This article will explain how the Act sets out to achieve this. It will cover:\nWho is Covered Under the Platform Workers Act?\nThe Act covers platform workers and platform operators, and applies to all platform services, which include on-demand delivery (e.g. Deliveroo, GrabFood) as well as ride-hailing services (e.g. Grab, TADA, Gojek).\nWho is a Platform Worker?\nA “platform worker” is defined as an individual who:\nContracts with platform operators to provide services; and\nIs subject to the management and control of the platform operator in return for payment or benefit in kind.\nCurrently, these services are limited to either ride-hailing or delivery services. Hence, platform workers would include ride-hail drivers and delivery riders. Platform workers operate with some level of autonomy, but are subject to the platform operator’s rules and management control. For example, they can choose their hours and location to work in, but will not be able to set the fare price or service fees for the rides.\nWho is a Platform Operator?\nA platform operator is defined as an organisation that:\nHas an agreement with users to provide ride-hail or delivery services to the users\nFacilitates these services through digital platforms, connecting platform workers with consumers; and\nExercises some level of management control over these platform workers.\nTypically, the platform operator will set the requirements on service levels, pricing and payment terms, as well as manage the work assignments for its platform workers. For example, Grab requires all its ride-hair and delivery drivers to adhere to a Code of Conduct when performing their jobs. As for payment terms, Grab only allows its drivers to cash out their earnings for a maximum of 2 times for every 24 hours upon reaching a minimum amount of S$50, up to a maximum of S$5,000 in earnings.\nA platform operator can be an individual or an entity such as a sole proprietorship, a corporate body, an unincorporated association, or a partnership. Some examples of platform operators in Singapore are companies like Grab, Gojek, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.\nDifferences Between Platform Workers vs. Self-Employed Persons vs. Employees\nPlatform workers vs. employees\nIf you are employed under a contract\nof\nservice with a platform operator, you are not a platform worker, but rather, an employee covered under the Employment Act. Workers employed under a contract of service typically enter into a written agreement with their employer to formalise the employee-employer relationship. Examples of such workers include managers, executives, manual labourers and professionals such as lawyers, accountants and doctors.\nOn the other hand, platform workers typically enter into a contract\nfor\nservice (i.e. a platform work agreement) which establishes a client-contractor relationship between the platform worker and the platform operator respectively. MOM defines a platform work agreement as any agreement – which includes written or oral agreements and expressed or implied agreements – between a platform operator and a platform worker for the provision of platform services but does not include a contract of service. This distinction is important because only platform workers who are not under a contract of service are eligible for the protections offered under the Act.\nYou may wish to check out our other article on the\ndifferences between a contract of service and contract for service\n.\nPlatform workers vs. self-employed persons\nSelf-employed persons also work under a contract for service as independent operators. They have the autonomy to set their own working hours and schedules, determine their own salary, work for multiple clients and are not under the control of any one platform.\nBefore the Act was introduced, platform workers were classified as ‘self-employed’. However, platform workers differ from self-employed persons due to the degree of management control. Platform operators would employ platform workers as independent contractors and often refer to them as “partners”, but these workers often do not have full control and management of their working circumstances. Unlike self-employed persons, they cannot decide how much to charge for their services, what tasks to take on and how to grow their client base – these are all determined by the platform operators.\nThe Act recognises the hybrid status of platform workers as a third category of workers, distinct from employees and self-employed workers. It also aims to address the reality of platform operators often exercising disproportionate power over these workers as the operators are often the ones determining these workers’ job allocation and payment terms.\nThe following sections will discuss how the Act intends to level the playing field between platform workers and platform operators and how the new rights and protections are designed to improve the financial, health, and representation rights of platform workers.\nWhat Protections are Available to Platform Workers Under the Platform Workers Act?\nThe Act aims to enhance the financial security, workplace safety and rights of representation for platform workers by strengthening protections for these workers in three main areas:\nIncreased Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions\n: Mandatory CPF contributions by both platform operators and platform workers, to ensure housing and retirement adequacy for platform workers.\nWork Injury Compensation\n: The provision of medical coverage and compensation for platform workers who get injured on the job.\nPlatform Work Associations\n: A legal framework will be set up to allow platform workers to organise and represent the interests of fellow platform workers.\n1. Increased CPF contribution rates\nOne of the most impactful provisions under the Act is that platform operators are now required to make CPF contributions for platform workers born on or after 1 January 1995. Older workers born before this date can either choose to opt in for increased CPF contributions, or stick with a lower level of their own mandatory contribution. This ensures that platform workers can have adequate savings for their retirement and healthcare needs, similar to employees under the Employment Act.\nPreviously, platform workers were only required to contribute up to 10.5% of their net trade income to their CPF Medisave account, while platform operators did not have any obligations to make any CPF contributions.\nThe key features under the new CPF requirements are discussed below.\nIncreased CPF contributions\nFor workers born on or after 1 January 1995, CPF contributions are mandatory and will gradually increase over a period of 5 years to allow platform workers and operators time to align with those of traditional employees. For traditional employees, the current CPF contribution rates are 20% for employees aged 55 and below, and 17% for their employers. The table below summarises the contribution rates of platform workers born on or after 1 January 1995 across the different age groups:\n2026 CPF Contribution Rates for Platform Workers\nAge\nPlatform operator’s share up to (%)\nPlatform worker’s share up to (%)\n35 & below\n7.0%\n13.0%\nAbove 35 to 45\n7.0%\n14.0%\nAbove 45 to 50\n7.0%\n15.0%\nAbove 50 to 55\n7.0%\n15.5%\nAbove 55 to 60\n7.0%\n15.5%\nAbove 60 to 65\n7.0%\n12.5%\nAbove 65 to 70\n7.0%\n9.5%\nAbove 70\n7.0%\n5.5%\nFor workers born before 1 January 1995, they will have the flexibility to decide whether to opt in to the increased CPF contributions or stick with a lower level of their own mandatory contribution if they wish to increase their amount of take-home pay. If they opt in, they will enjoy the same benefits and are eligible for the same support as platform workers born on 1 January 1995 or later. The table below summarises the contribution rates of platform workers born before 1 January 1995 who do not opt in, across the different age groups.\nSource: CPF website\nFor platform workers who are mandated or opt in to increased CPF contributions, these CPF contributions will go toward their Ordinary, Special and MediSave Accounts. Platform workers who do not opt in to increased CPF contributions will continue to contribute to the MediSave Account only; they will not receive CPF contributions from the platform operator.\nPlatform workers can\nopt-in via the CPF website\n. Do note that this decision to opt in is irreversible. This is because allowing opt-outs will be counterproductive to the Act’s intention of allowing workers to accumulate interest in their CPF accounts for housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. Allowing workers to opt in and out multiple times is also impractical for platform operators as they will incur additional costs by constantly having to monitor the status and CPF contribution rates of their workers. While there is no deadline to opt in, older workers are encouraged to do so as early as possible so that they can start benefiting from the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support Scheme (discussed in the next section below) earlier.\nPlatform operators must make prompt and accurate CPF contributions for their Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident platform workers every month. They are responsible for deducting the platform workers’ share of CPF contributions from their platform workers’ earnings as and when they are earned, and to submit them to the CPF Board, along with the platform operator’s share of CPF contributions.\nPlatform Workers CPF Transition Support Scheme\nLow-income platform workers will receive additional support under the enhanced Platform Workers CPF Transition Support scheme (PCTS). This will help alleviate their concerns that increased CPF deductions would reduce their take-home pay.\nUnder this enhanced scheme, lower-income platform workers earning $3,000 or less in net monthly income from platform work (previously capped at $2,500 monthly) and who are affected by the increased CPF deductions will receive direct cash payouts in the first year (i.e. 2025) to fully offset the increased CPF contributions. Thereafter, the payout will reduce by 25 per cent per year until 2028, as illustrated below:\nSource: CPF Website\nWorkfare Income Supplement Scheme\nLower-income platform workers will still be eligible for the PCTS even if they already receive support from other schemes, such as the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (WIS). Effectively, this means that the increased CPF contributions under the Act will allow them to boost their retirement savings without removing their eligibility for current assistance.\nFrom 2025, eligible platform workers will receive their WIS payments on a monthly basis, instead of annually. They will continue to receive the same amount of WIS payments as a self-employed person from 2025 to 2028. The table below shows the maximum WIS amount that the platform worker can receive each year, based on their age group.\nSource: CPF Website\nWith effect from 2029, eligible platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contribution rates will receive higher WIS payments once their CPF contribution rates fully align with that of traditional employees. They will also receive a higher proportion of WIS payments in cash at 40%, compared to the current 10%.\nAs for those who do not opt in to the increased CPF contribution rates, they will continue to receive their WIS payments at the same level as that of a self-employed person.\nPlatform workers and operators may wish to refer to the\nCPF website\nfor further details on the computation and collection of CPF contributions, the caps for eligibility, as well as government’s support for lower-income platform workers.\nSafeguards against discrimination\nWhile the scope of the legislation is to primarily offer greater protection to platform workers, this naturally translates into further responsibilities and significantly increased costs for affected platform operators.\nFor platform workers who are mandated or opt in to the increased CPF contribution rates, this will result in a higher costs for the platform operators who will have to make contributions to their platform workers’ CPF accounts. This may in turn open up the risk of discrimination by platform operators against such platform workers. There is also the risk that some operators will pass on the higher costs to the platform workers. In response to this, Parliament has stated that it would be disingenuous for platform operators to seek to recover these higher costs from platform workers, and urged platform operators to refrain from doing so. Parliament further highlighted that the added costs incurred by platform operators on the mandatory CPF contributions can be audited to counter any claims of profiteering and to prevent a passing of costs to platform workers by the platform operators.\nFor added protection, tripartite partners – namely the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) – will be including additional guidelines in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices in due course. The additional guidelines will provide greater clarity that intermediaries such as platform operators should not discriminate based on characteristics that are not related to the job, including when allocating work to platform workers.\nFinally, Platform Work Associations (discussed below) can work together with platform operators to safeguard against discriminatory practices.\n2. Work Injury Compensation\nThe second area of protection for platform workers under the Act is the provision of financial security for platform workers in case of work-related accidents or injury. Previously, there was no mandatory legal requirement for platform operators to provide coverage for platform workers injured on the job, so any benefit of insurance coverage offered to platform workers was largely dependent on the goodwill of the platform operators.\nThe reality is that platform workers (i.e. delivery riders and private-hire vehicle drivers) face significant risks in the course of their work. Due to the nature of work, they often spend significant amounts of time on the road and are exposed to a greater risk of traffic accidents – a survey found that around a third of delivery riders in Singapore had experienced an injury requiring medical treatment.\nThe Act mandates that platform operators provide insurance to its platform workers at the same scope and level of benefits that traditional employees enjoy under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA). This strengthens the responsibilities of platform workers and platform operators to prevent injuries at work.\nThe types of compensation offered should cover the following as a minimum standard:\nMedical leave wages or income replacement\nMedical expenses\nLump sum compensation in the event of permanent incapacity or injury, current incapacity or injury, or death\nIt should be noted that compensation for light duties will not apply to platform workers.\nEligibility for claims\nWorkers can claim compensation under WICA for any injury sustained in the course of their work, i.e. if they were injured in a road accident while performing delivery tasks and ride-hail platform operators. They are covered from pick-up to drop-off, which is defined as:\nPick-up\n: When the platform worker begins to travel to the pick-up or collection location until the platform worker leaves the pick-up or collection location, including returning to the vehicle, where applicable for delivery platform services.\nDrop-off\n: When the platform worker begins to travel to the drop-off or delivery location until the platform worker leaves the drop-off or delivery location, including returning to the vehicle, where applicable for delivery platform services.\nA platform worker can also make a claim under WICA if the platform worker contracts an occupational disease in the course of work. However, injuries sustained outside the scope described and from personal activities outside work are not covered. For example, a ride-hail driver will not be covered under WICA if he gets into an accident on the way to collect a personal parcel after dropping off a passenger.\nIf a worker is injured while working for multiple operators, they are entitled to compensation in proportion to the income earned from each operator.\nCompensation coverage\nPlatform Workers will have the same level of Work Injury Compensation (WIC) coverage as employees, comprising:\nReimbursement for medical expenses\nIncome loss compensation for medical leave and hospitalisation leave\nLump-sum compensation for permanent incapacity or death\nTo streamline processes for WIC claims, a Fixed Expense Deduction Amount will be applied to all Platform Workers’ gross earnings to derive Platform Workers’ net earnings (i.e. gross earnings minus the Fixed Expense Deduction Amount). The net earnings will be used to compute WIC quantum. The Fixed Expense Deduction Amount depends on platform workers’ mode of transport and reflects expenses for the majority of platform workers.\nClaims process\nPlatform workers can file claims with their platform operator’s insurance provider by submitting an injury report (iReport) through the MOM portal within 10 days of notification of accident to the platform operator. For fatal accidents, notification must be given to MOM as soon as possible.\nFor non-fatal accidents, platform workers can claim compensation within one year of the date of the accident, or up to the limitation period of the occupational disease (if applicable) even if they no longer work for the platform operator.\nMore detailed information on claim eligibility and procedures, how compensation is computed and the compensation limits, is available on the\nMOM website\n.\n3. Platform Work Associations\nA final area of protection which the Act seeks to strengthen is the collective bargaining power of platform workers. Previously, there was no legal framework for the representation of platform workers as they were not considered employees. The Act now provides for a legal representation framework to be set up, which will allow platform workers to form and be collectively represented as a Platform Work Association (PWA). A PWA must apply to the Registry of PWAs to be registered, and Registrars will be appointed by MOM to regulate and oversee the activities conducted by PWAs.\nRegistered PWAs can represent platform workers and negotiate on their behalf if they obtain the mandate to do so, either through recognition by a platform operator or a ballot among its members. They can then represent the platform workers in work-related disputes and negotiate with platform operators to further the interests of platform workers. This strengthens the collective bargaining power and voice of platform workers, allowing them to collectively advocate for fair treatment of platform workers, such as negotiating better working conditions, fair payment terms and improved benefits.\nWhat Happens If Platform Operators Do Not Adhere to Their Obligations Under the Platform Workers Act?\nThe Act confers a heavier administrative burden on platform operators, as they now need to implement various measures to comply with the Act’s requirements. Failure to comply with these obligations may mean administrative penalties for platform operators.\nFor example, a platform operator’s failure to submit the requisite CPF contributions by the 14th of the following month (or the next working day if the 14th falls on a weekend or public holiday) will result in enforcement action by MOM and the relevant authorities. This may include the imposition of a late payment interest charged at 1.5% per month commencing from the first day after the due date.\nIf platform operators fail to meet their obligations, platform workers also have avenues for legal recourse, either through MOM or by seeking representation from PWAs or employment lawyers.\nHow does the Platform Workers Act Interplay with Existing Employment Guidelines or Legislation?\nThe Act works alongside other existing guidelines, such as the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices and Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) as discussed above. These guidelines ensure that all workers in Singapore, including platform workers, are treated fairly and without discrimination.\nThe Act is intended to strengthen the protections for platform workers without altering or diminishing their rights under existing legislation and guidelines, providing an additional layer of security in the gig economy. As the gig economy evolves, MOM and PWAs may negotiate or enhance further protections and regulations for platform workers.\n—\nWith the Platform Workers Act, Singapore is leading the way in bridging the gap between traditional employment protections and the evolving needs of the gig economy. The Act is a welcome legislation that seeks to ensure that platform workers will now have better access to fair treatment, financial security, and safer working conditions moving forward.\nIf you are a platform worker or operator looking for more detailed advice,\nconsulting an employment lawyer\ncould be beneficial in assessing your rights and obligations under the Act. An employment lawyer can help you clarify specific rights or eligibility under the provisions of the Act, guide you through filing a claim or onboarding new platform workers, or assist in cases of non-compliance by platform operators.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

This article will explain how the Act sets out to achieve this. It will cover:\nWho is Covered Under the Platform Workers Act?\nThe Act covers platform workers and platform operators, and applies to all platform services, which include on-demand delivery (e.g. Deliveroo, GrabFood) as well as ride-hailing services (e.g. Grab, TADA, Gojek).\nWho is a Platform Worker?\nA “platform worker” is defined as an individual who:\nContracts with platform operators to provide services; and\nIs subject to the management and control of the platform operator in return for payment or benefit in kind.\nCurrently, these services are limited to either ride-hailing or delivery services. Hence, platform workers would include ride-hail drivers and delivery riders. Platform workers operate with some level of autonomy, but are subject to the platform operator’s rules and management control. For example, they can choose their hours and location to work in, but will not be able to set the fare price or service fees for the rides.\nWho is a Platform Operator?\nA platform operator is defined as an organisation that:\nHas an agreement with users to provide ride-hail or delivery services to the users\nFacilitates these services through digital platforms, connecting platform workers with consumers; and\nExercises some level of management control over these platform workers.\nTypically, the platform operator will set the requirements on service levels, pricing and payment terms, as well as manage the work assignments for its platform workers. For example, Grab requires all its ride-hair and delivery drivers to adhere to a Code of Conduct when performing their jobs. As for payment terms, Grab only allows its drivers to cash out their earnings for a maximum of 2 times for every 24 hours upon reaching a minimum amount of S$50, up to a maximum of S$5,000 in earnings.\nA platform operator can be an individual or an entity such as a sole proprietorship, a corporate body, an unincorporated association, or a partnership. Some examples of platform operators in Singapore are companies like Grab, Gojek, Foodpanda and Deliveroo.\nDifferences Between Platform Workers vs. Self-Employed Persons vs. Employees\nPlatform workers vs. employees\nIf you are employed under a contract\nof\nservice with a platform operator, you are not a platform worker, but rather, an employee covered under the Employment Act. Workers employed under a contract of service typically enter into a written agreement with their employer to formalise the employee-employer relationship. Examples of such workers include managers, executives, manual labourers and professionals such as lawyers, accountants and doctors.\nOn the other hand, platform workers typically enter into a contract\nfor\nservice (i.e. a platform work agreement) which establishes a client-contractor relationship between the platform worker and the platform operator respectively. MOM defines a platform work agreement as any agreement – which includes written or oral agreements and expressed or implied agreements – between a platform operator and a platform worker for the provision of platform services but does not include a contract of service. This distinction is important because only platform workers who are not under a contract of service are eligible for the protections offered under the Act.\nYou may wish to check out our other article on the\ndifferences between a contract of service and contract for service\n.\nPlatform workers vs. self-employed persons\nSelf-employed persons also work under a contract for service as independent operators. They have the autonomy to set their own working hours and schedules, determine their own salary, work for multiple clients and are not under the control of any one platform.\nBefore the Act was introduced, platform workers were classified as ‘self-employed’. However, platform workers differ from self-employed persons due to the degree of management control. Platform operators would employ platform workers as independent contractors and often refer to them as “partners”, but these workers often do not have full control and management of their working circumstances. Unlike self-employed persons, they cannot decide how much to charge for their services, what tasks to take on and how to grow their client base – these are all determined by the platform operators.\nThe Act recognises the hybrid status of platform workers as a third category of workers, distinct from employees and self-employed workers. It also aims to address the reality of platform operators often exercising disproportionate power over these workers as the operators are often the ones determining these workers’ job allocation and payment terms.\nThe following sections will discuss how the Act intends to level the playing field between platform workers and platform operators and how the new rights and protections are designed to improve the financial, health, and representation rights of platform workers.\nWhat Protections are Available to Platform Workers Under the Platform Workers Act?\nThe Act aims to enhance the financial security, workplace safety and rights of representation for platform workers by strengthening protections for these workers in three main areas:\nIncreased Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions\n: Mandatory CPF contributions by both platform operators and platform workers, to ensure housing and retirement adequacy for platform workers.\nWork Injury Compensation\n: The provision of medical coverage and compensation for platform workers who get injured on the job.\nPlatform Work Associations\n: A legal framework will be set up to allow platform workers to organise and represent the interests of fellow platform workers.\n1. Increased CPF contribution rates\nOne of the most impactful provisions under the Act is that platform operators are now required to make CPF contributions for platform workers born on or after 1 January 1995. Older workers born before this date can either choose to opt in for increased CPF contributions, or stick with a lower level of their own mandatory contribution. This ensures that platform workers can have adequate savings for their retirement and healthcare needs, similar to employees under the Employment Act.\nPreviously, platform workers were only required to contribute up to 10.5% of their net trade income to their CPF Medisave account, while platform operators did not have any obligations to make any CPF contributions.\nThe key features under the new CPF requirements are discussed below.\nIncreased CPF contributions\nFor workers born on or after 1 January 1995, CPF contributions are mandatory and will gradually increase over a period of 5 years to allow platform workers and operators time to align with those of traditional employees. For traditional employees, the current CPF contribution rates are 20% for employees aged 55 and below, and 17% for their employers. The table below summarises the contribution rates of platform workers born on or after 1 January 1995 across the different age groups:\n2026 CPF Contribution Rates for Platform Workers\nAge\nPlatform operator’s share up to (%)\nPlatform worker’s share up to (%)\n35 & below\n7.0%\n13.0%\nAbove 35 to 45\n7.0%\n14.0%\nAbove 45 to 50\n7.0%\n15.0%\nAbove 50 to 55\n7.0%\n15.5%\nAbove 55 to 60\n7.0%\n15.5%\nAbove 60 to 65\n7.0%\n12.5%\nAbove 65 to 70\n7.0%\n9.5%\nAbove 70\n7.0%\n5.5%\nFor workers born before 1 January 1995, they will have the flexibility to decide whether to opt in to the increased CPF contributions or stick with a lower level of their own mandatory contribution if they wish to increase their amount of take-home pay. If they opt in, they will enjoy the same benefits and are eligible for the same support as platform workers born on 1 January 1995 or later. The table below summarises the contribution rates of platform workers born before 1 January 1995 who do not opt in, across the different age groups.\nSource: CPF website\nFor platform workers who are mandated or opt in to increased CPF contributions, these CPF contributions will go toward their Ordinary, Special and MediSave Accounts. Platform workers who do not opt in to increased CPF contributions will continue to contribute to the MediSave Account only; they will not receive CPF contributions from the platform operator.\nPlatform workers can\nopt-in via the CPF website\n. Do note that this decision to opt in is irreversible. This is because allowing opt-outs will be counterproductive to the Act’s intention of allowing workers to accumulate interest in their CPF accounts for housing and retirement adequacy in the long run. Allowing workers to opt in and out multiple times is also impractical for platform operators as they will incur additional costs by constantly having to monitor the status and CPF contribution rates of their workers. While there is no deadline to opt in, older workers are encouraged to do so as early as possible so that they can start benefiting from the Platform Workers CPF Transition Support Scheme (discussed in the next section below) earlier.\nPlatform operators must make prompt and accurate CPF contributions for their Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident platform workers every month. They are responsible for deducting the platform workers’ share of CPF contributions from their platform workers’ earnings as and when they are earned, and to submit them to the CPF Board, along with the platform operator’s share of CPF contributions.\nPlatform Workers CPF Transition Support Scheme\nLow-income platform workers will receive additional support under the enhanced Platform Workers CPF Transition Support scheme (PCTS).

An employment lawyer can help you clarify specific rights or eligibility under the provisions of the Act, guide you through filing a claim or onboarding new platform workers, or assist in cases of non-compliance by platform operators.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

An ex gratia payment is a voluntary payment made to an individual even though the party making the payment is not obligated to do so. Such payments are generally regarded as a gesture of goodwill to maintain good relations.\nIn the context of employment laws in Singapore, an employee may receive voluntary payment from an organisation, government ministry, or company which he works for without any contractual obligation. This generally takes place when the employment relationship ends, for example, upon the employee leaving the company.\nThis article will cover:\nWhat is the Difference Between Severance Payments and Ex Gratia Payments?\nSeverance pay is a compensation and/or retrenchment benefit that an employer offers an employee upon termination of their employment contract. Such payments are typically offered when employees are retrenched or laid off due to a company restructure or downsizing.\nSeverance payments may be contractually provided for in an employee’s contract and is a legal requirement under the Employment Act for employees who have worked for a company for more than 2 years. On the other hand, an ex gratia payment is wholly dependent on the goodwill of the company and is generally not referenced in employment contracts.\nThis means employees working for the company for less than 2 years and whose contract does not provide for severance payments, can only rely on the ex gratia payments of the company to reward them for their work done.\nWhen Do Employers Pay Ex Gratia Payments?\nAn employer may offer an ex gratia payment for several reasons, including to:\nReward an employee’s good performance\nRecognise an employee’s service\nResolve or settle a legal dispute with an employee out of court\nThe employer typically offers an ex gratia payment when the employee leaves the company. For example, where the employment contract does not state that the employee is entitled to severance payments, the employer may still pay the employee ex gratia payments in recognition of the employee’s service.\nAlternatively, the payment may arise as a result of a negotiated settlement following a legal dispute (e.g., where the employee claims unfair dismissal or workplace discrimination by the employer). In order to resolve this legal dispute with an employee, an employer might make an ex gratia offer. Even if the employment relationship ends, the aim might be to prevent unfavourable publicity for the company or avoid costly litigation. In such cases, the employee would usually be expected to sign a settlement agreement to receive the ex gratia payment to ensure that the employee would not pursue any further legal claims against the employer.\nHow Much Ex Gratia Payment is the Employee Entitled to?\nThe ex gratia payment amount is not fixed and can vary from company to company according to the employer’s wishes. Various factors may be taken into consideration such as:\nThe employee’s contributions\n– the employer may consider the significance of the employee’s contributions to the company and make an offer that adequately rewards such contributions.\nWhether the employee suffers any actual or perceived loss\n– if possible, the employer would use the monetary sum of the loss to assess how the ex gratia payments would measure up against the financial loss suffered by the employee. E.g., if the employee is involved in an unfortunate work accident that affects his ability to work, the loss in earning capacity suffered by the employee is the difference between the employee’s pre-accident earnings and the amount that he earns after the accident. The employer would use the loss of earning capacity to calculate the ex gratia offer in order to compensate the employee for his loss.\nCommercial considerations, including budget\n– how much financial resources the employer has to pay the employee.\nReputational risks\n– the employer may weigh the costs of a legal dispute with the employee not being kept confidential. E.g., the employer may offer ex gratia compensation to the employee in order to settle the dispute out of court and avoid any negative press.\nLegal risks\n– where the employee intends to pursue a valid legal claim against the company, the employer may assess the costs of possible litigation when considering how much ex gratia payment to offer. The employer may arrive at the conclusion that it is more cost-effective to offer ex gratia payments compared to hiring a lawyer to deal with the legal claim. E.g., the prospective costs of litigation, including filing fees and legal fees, are estimated to be $10,000. The employer can use this amount as a gauge of how much ex gratia payment should be offered to avoid such litigation costs. It would be financially sensible to offer an amount of ex gratia payment to the employee that is less than $10,000.\nThe employee’s salary/remuneration\n– the employee’s salary would serve as an indicator of how significant the ex gratia offer is.\nSince ex gratia is a voluntary payment, there is no fixed method on how to calculate these payments. Unlike a legal claim, where employees can file a claim with the Ministry of Manpower or take the case to court, employees do not have a legal avenue of recourse to dispute the amount of ex gratia payment. There is no governing body overseeing the proper calculation of gratuity amounts or legal action that they can bring.\nLegally Entitled Payments vs. Ex Gratia Payments\nGenerally, companies are not obligated to offer ex gratia payments and they are viewed as a gesture of goodwill. This should be in addition to what the employee is legally entitled to, meaning that ex gratia payments made in place of what is already owed to the employee are not genuine ex gratia payments.\nFor example, an employee who recently resigned has an annual leave balance that amounts to $1,000. This $1,000 that is paid in addition to the employee’s final salary payment before the employee leaves is not an ex gratia payment, but the employee’s legal entitlement by law (i.e. the encashment of unused leave).\nOn the other hand, any additional payment of retrenchment benefits above and beyond what the employee is entitled to is a payment made out of goodwill and considered ex gratia. For example, in the employee’s retrenchment agreement, the employer may offer $1,000 in recognition of the employee’s contributions during the period that he was in the company. This is not a sum that the employee is originally entitled to and is considered a genuine gesture of goodwill.\nDifferentiating between legally entitled payments and ex gratia payments will determine whether the employee can bring a legal claim for the sum of money. If the sum is part of the employee’s legal entitlement, the payment is not ex gratia and the employee can bring a legal claim for that amount.\nCPF deductions of Ex Gratia Payments\nAs an employee, any payment of wages attracts CPF contribution. Under the\nCPF Act\n, wages are defined as remuneration in money, including bonuses that are due or granted to a person in respect of their employment.\nWhether an ex gratia payment also requires the payment of CPF contributions is dependent on the nature of the ex gratia payment.\nEx gratia payments given in respect of the employee’s employment are subject to CPF contributions, such as where the payment is to:\nReward your employee’s good performance,\nReward your employee for the completion of a contract/project,\nEntice your employee to remain in employment, or\nRecognise your employee’s service with you.\nConversely, if the ex gratia payment is given for termination or loss of employment, CPF contributions are not payable. These payments are not considered wages and are not CPF-deductible as they are not given for service or work done by the employee.\nTax Payable on Ex Gratia Payments\nAccording to the\nIncome Tax Act\n, income tax is meant to be levied on gains or profits from any employment, including wages, bonuses and gratuity.\nHence, to determine if the payment is taxable, one has to examine the nature of the payment itself. Generally, payments made by an employer to an employee as compensation for loss of employment, such as during retrenchment, or where the employment term has come to an end, are not taxable in Singapore. Such payments are considered capital receipts, which means that it is an incoming cash flow from non-operating sources. This is differentiated from income which is earned for active work done by the employee.\nConversely, if the payment is not for loss of employment and are ex-gratia payments for past services, these payments are considered payment for services and are therefore taxable.\nIn practice, however, the intent and nature of payment may be difficult to determine. The taxability of payments should be based on nature, characteristic and intent rather than how the payment is termed or written in the contract.\nConfidentiality of Ex Gratia Payments\nDepending on the intent of the ex gratia payment, the employee may be asked to sign a settlement agreement or confidentiality agreement as a condition for accepting and receiving the payment.\nOne example would be when an ex gratia payment is offered to settle a legal dispute; the employer might ask the employee to sign a settlement agreement not to commence legal proceedings against the employer as a condition of the settlement payment. In addition, the employee might also be asked to sign a confidentiality agreement where the employee would agree not to disclose details of the dispute to the media or future employers so that the employer can avoid any negative publicity.\nOnce a legally binding document (such as a settlement agreement or confidentiality agreement) is signed, the employer may take legal action against the employee if they breach the terms of the agreement. If the employer’s case succeeds, the employer may be able to obtain damages for the loss suffered or even an injunction against the employee not to breach the signed confidentiality agreement.\nDoes Accepting Ex Gratia Payment Mean That an Employee Cannot Take Further Legal Action Against the Employer?\nThis would depend on whether the employee has signed a contract and the specific terms of the contract. If the ex gratia payment has been accepted and a legally enforceable settlement agreement is signed, the employee would unlikely be able to take further legal action, as they would otherwise risk being in default of the settlement agreement. In such a case, the employer may commence legal proceedings to enforce the settlement agreement.\nFor example, in a 2022 High Court case,\nthe next of kin of an employee who had tragically passed away following a workplace accident were given ex gratia payments as part of a settlement agreement. The parties signed a deed that discharged the employer from any further payment in contract, tort or other law. However, the next of kin of the deceased employee subsequently lodged a claim for compensation with the Commissioner for Labour (Commission) under Workplace Injury Compensation Act (WICA). Under the WICA, the Commission can assess the amount of compensation as part of alternative remedies apart from those in contract, tort or other law. The issue was whether the Commission should take into account the ex gratia payment made by the employer to the employee’s next of kin when assessing the amount of compensation payable under WICA.\nThe court decided that WICA was meant to facilitate quicker payment of compensation to workmen as compared to legal claims. Although WICA does not explicitly require the Commissioner to take the ex gratia payment into account, WICA does not allow an employee (in this case, the employee’s next of kin on behalf of the employee) who has already received a settlement payment from his employer to also obtain compensation in respect of the same injury. The court also found the ex gratia settlement payment amount to be fair and adequate. As such, taking the ex gratia settlement payments into account, the court decided that no further compensation was payable to the employee’s next of kin.\nNevertheless, whether the employee has a valid claim would depend on the statute that the employee is claiming under and whether the statute would allow for claims other than that in law. This area of law may be contentious and the employee is advised to seek legal advice regarding his particular case before commencing any legal proceedings.\n—\nIn summary, ex gratia payments are voluntary payments that an employer can offer to its employee, usually at the end of their employment. Unlike legally entitled payments, ex gratia payments are made on a voluntary basis. Nevertheless, the intent behind making the ex gratia payments will determine whether they are subject to CPF deductions and taxes. Likewise, the option of pursuing legal action after the ex gratia payment is accepted would also depend on the precise circumstances of the case and the terms of any agreement that may have been signed by the parties concerned.\nSince any possible legal claims would depend on the facts of the case, you should\nseek advice from an experienced employment lawyer\nfor further guidance on this topic. If you are an employee, a lawyer can help to evaluate your specific case and suggest possible avenues of action that you may wish to take against your employer, if any.  A lawyer can also advise an employer on making ex gratia payments and protecting their interests in the event they are the subject of a legal dispute concerning ex gratia payments.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Whether you are an employee or an employer, understanding payment-related terminologies and concepts is crucial to understanding your employment obligations or rights.\nThis article aims to explain the different terms that are used when discussing payments associated with performing work. It will cover:\nWhat is Remuneration?\nRemuneration refers to the total financial compensation that an employee receives from their employer for their work and services.\nThe following table sets out the definitions of each form of remuneration:\nForms of remuneration\nDefinition\nMandatory or Non-Mandatory\nCPF contributions\nContributions to employee’s Central Provident Fund (CPF)\nCPF is a social security savings scheme where the total CPF contributions for an employee comprise the employee’s share of the contribution and that of the employer’s. CPF contributions range from 12.5% to 37% of your monthly wages (depending on the employee’s age) and are payable to employees who are Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents.\nNote: For more information on whether CPF contributions are applicable to you and the relevant contribution rates, please refer to our article on\nCPF contribution\n.\nMandatory\nOvertime payments\nAdditional compensation for hours worked beyond the standard workweek\nNote: For more information on your eligibility to claim overtime pay, please refer to the\nMinistry of Manpower’s website\n.\nBonuses\nLump-sum payments based on performance, company profits or other criteria\nNot mandatory unless specified in the employment contract\nCommissions\nA percentage-based payment tied to sales or specific business targets\nIncentive payments\nRewards for achieving specific goals\nAllowance\nSupplement payment for work-related expenses such as travelling expenses and subscriptions paid to professional bodies\nWithin this umbrella of remuneration, you will find both wages and salary, which are two common ways an employer pays an employee for their contribution to the company. This article will delve into wages and salaries in the subsequent sections.\nWhat are Wages?\nUnder the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Act, wages are defined as remuneration in money, including any bonuses that are due or granted to a person in respect of his employment. In other words, they are payments for hours worked or days spent on the job. This payment structure is particularly suited for roles where working hours can fluctuate and job tasks may vary. This means that wages credit units of work as opposed to periodic payments, like a salary.\nFor example, you get a job offer to work as a part-time sales associate at a retail store where your job scope involves assisting customers, restocking shelves and operating the cash register. In this case, you will be paid wages. This is because you do not work for a fixed number of hours per day or a fixed number of days per week. Therefore, the amount of money that you will receive depends on the specific number of hours and days you work as well as the type of tasks you perform.\nDoes Singapore have a minimum wage?\nIt is worth noting that Singapore does not currently have a minimum wage. A minimum wage, defined as the lowest pay for an hour’s work that can legally be paid to a worker, is primarily designed to safeguard employees from receiving unreasonably low pay. In contrast to Singapore, countries such as Germany and Australia have a legally mandated minimum wage system.\nIn Singapore, instead of a legally mandated minimum wage, there exists a\nProgressive Wage Model\n(PWM) aimed at supporting lower-wage workers. The government has introduced the PWM as an initiative to enhance wages, serving as an alternative to minimum wage laws. Apart from upgrading the skills and productivity of lower-wage workers, the PWM has a Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) that rewards work and individual effort by supplementing salaries. These rewards come in the form of cash and CPF top-ups, helping lower-wage workers meet their expenditure needs and save for retirement.\nEmployees covered by the PWM can expect cumulative wage increases until 2029. For example, from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025, general cleaners working in conservancies (e.g. town councils) will have to be paid at least $2,060. Over the following year, from 1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026, their minimum wages will be increased to $1,910. By 2029, their minimum wages will be increased to $2,420.\nWhat is a Salary?\nUnder the Employment Act, salary refers to all remuneration including allowances payable to an employee in respect of work done under their contract of service. It is a fixed form of payment that an employee receives at a stipulated time (e.g. end of the month, fortnightly, or on a fixed date each month).\nHowever, an employee’s salary does not include:\nThe value of accommodation, utilities or other amenities\nPension or provident fund contribution paid by the employer\nTravel allowance\nPayments for expenses incurred during work\nGratuity payable on discharge or retirement\nRetrenchment benefits\nSalary terms in an employment contract\nTo avoid employment disputes over payment of salaries, it is pertinent for employment contracts to stipulate the frequency of salary payments as a term in the employment contract.\nEmployers are obligated to pay their employees at least once a month and within 7 days after the end of the salary period. However, this does not stop an employer from paying its employees at shorter intervals. Put differently, this means that your employer is permitted to make a payment at the end of the third week, even if your employment contract stipulates a four-week payment interval.\nIn addition to specifying how often salaries are paid, an employment contract should encompass other crucial payment-related terms, when relevant. These terms include:\nThe duration of the salary period\nThe base salary\nFixed allowances\nFixed deductions\nOvertime payment period\nThe rate of pay for overtime work\nBonuses\nIncentives\nAs salaries can change due to factors like promotions or shifts in working hours, it is also important that the employment contract updates and states these new salary terms accordingly to avoid salary-related disputes.\nWhat happens if an employer fails to pay salary?\nIf your employer fails to provide your salary payment on time, the following steps can be taken:\nApproach your employer to inquire about any reasons for the delay.\nIf your salary is still not received, you have the option to file a payment-related claim with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) or seek assistance from your labour union.\nIt is important to submit your claim promptly to prevent the accumulation of the owed amount. This is because there are constraints regarding the maximum claim amount and the timeframe within which you can file your claim. A maximum of S$20,000 or S$30,000 can be claimed if you go through TADM or mediation assisted by unions recognised under the Industrial Relations Act. The claim must also be made within 1 year from when the dispute arises if you are still employed by the company, and 6 months from your last day of work if you are no longer employed by your company.\nFor a more detailed overview of salary payments, please refer to our other article on\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\n.\nWhat is the Difference Between Gross Pay and Net Pay?\nGross pay\nGross pay refers to the initial amount of money an employee earns without accounting for any deductions that may be made. The most common forms of deduction in Singapore would be CPF contributions and ethnicity-based development funds through self-help groups (SHG) funds. This refers to a portion of your gross pay that will be deducted to support initiatives aimed at improving the well-being of low-income households and less privileged individuals within your specific ethnic group. Depending on your ethnicity, your contributions to SHG funds will be channelled to one of the following organisations:\nChinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) Fund\nEurasian Community Fund (ECF)\nMosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF)\nSingapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) Fund.\nNet pay\nOn the other hand, net pay refers to the actual amount of money that an employee receives once the relevant deductions from the gross pay have been made. To put it differently, net pay can be described as your take-home pay, which is essentially the pay you effectively ‘take home’.\nFor example, suppose you are a fresh graduate who earns a gross pay of $4,000. Based on the current CPF deduction rates, 20% of your gross pay would be contributed to your CPF account. This means that $800 will be deducted from your gross pay. Assuming no other deductions are made, your net pay, or ‘take-home’ pay,  will be $3,200.\n—\nIn conclusion, remuneration plays a pivotal role as the comprehensive compensation framework in the employment landscape. It encompasses various elements, including wages and salaries, each tailored to suit different job structures and employee needs.\nPrecise understanding of these terminologies is of paramount importance when making informed decisions during job negotiations as well as effective management of compensation-related matters. For employees, it is vital to be aware of your rights and benefits concerning your remuneration. Therefore, grasping these terms will enable you to discuss a suitable payment structure during contract negotiations. On the employer’s side, it is imperative to ensure compliance with the regulations and laws established by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). As a responsible employer, it is your duty to remunerate your employees fairly.\nShould you require further legal advice or assistance in interpreting the payment terms of your employment contract, and/or would like to hire a lawyer to assist with a payment dispute between you and your employer or employee, you may\nget in touch with one of our employment dispute lawyers\n.\nOur employment lawyers possess the expertise to review your employment contract, ensuring that its terms, including those related to compensation, are fair and legally sound. They can also offer guidance on employment laws and regulations, ensuring that both employers and employees adhere to the requisite legal standards.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

{"chunk_id": "SLA_a093bcfe", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "Sick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employer Obligations > Sick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore", "text": "Sick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nLast updated on July 13, 2025\nEmployees who have served an employer in Singapore for a period of time are generally entitled to sick leave or medical leave (colloquially known as “MC” in Singapore). This article will help you know your rights and obligations as an employee when taking sick leave in Singapore. It will cover:\nWhat is Sick Leave?\nAn employee may be entitled to paid sick leave after examination by a medical practitioner and certification by that medical practitioner that the employee is unfit to work. This allows you to rest and recover before returning to work. The number of paid sick leave days that you are entitled to depends on the number of months of service completed.\nSick leave entitlements are governed by the\nEmployment Act\n(EA) which is Singapore’s main labour law. It provides for the basic terms and conditions at work for employees covered by the EA.\nThe main purpose of the EA is to safeguard employees’ working conditions and maintain good employment standards.\nWhat types of employees are covered by the Employment Act?\nThe EA generally covers an employee working under a contract of service with an employer and includes full-time, part-time, temporary and contract employees. The employee will be covered regardless of whether the employee is paid on an hourly, daily, monthly or piece-rated basis.\nThe EA does not make a distinction between local or foreign employees.\nThus, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and non-citizens who work in Singapore will be covered by the EA. However, certain employees are excluded under the EA.\nIf an employee works less than 35 hours a week, they are part-time employees covered by the\nEmployment of Part-Time Employees Regulations\n. Self-employed persons, seafarers, domestic workers and statutory board employees are not covered by the EA.\nInstead, their employment terms will be set out in their employment contract.\nWho is Eligible For Sick Leave in Singapore?\nTo be eligible for sick leave, all of the following criteria have to be met:\nYou are covered under the Employment Act\nYou have served your employer for at least 3 months\nYou have informed or tried to inform your employer within 48 hours of your absence\nTo qualify for paid sick leave, you must be certified to be unfit for work by a medical practitioner registered under the Medical Registration Act or Dental Registration Act.\nIf you visited a Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner (TCMP), your employer may not recognise the medical certificates issued by TCMPs for the purpose of granting paid sick leave.\nEmployers are not required to grant paid sick leave or pay medical consultation fees for cosmetic procedures. If you are unsure of whether a procedure is cosmetic or not, you may consult the medical practitioner performing the medical examination who will determine the purpose of the procedure. Even if it is a cosmetic procedure, your company may cover this under the company’s internal policy.\nHowever, an employee is not eligible to apply for paid sick leave if they fall sick during:\nRest days: Employees have dedicated days of no work within a week. Your employer may prepare a monthly roster to inform you of the rest days before the start of each month\nPublic holidays: An employee under the EA is entitled to 11 gazetted public holidays in a year (e.g., New Year, Hari Raya, Christmas)\nNon-working days: For an employee with a 5-day work week, weekends are typically considered non-working days\nAnnual leave: Paid days of leave that an employee is entitled to within a year\nUnpaid leave: Days of leave that an employee takes without being paid a salary for the duration of the leave\nWhat are Your Sick Leave Entitlements?\nGenerally, the number of sick leave that you are entitled to is in accordance with the period of service with your employer. This is to ensure that the responsibilities placed on the employer are proportional to the length of service of the employee.\nThe period of service and the corresponding number of sick leave is illustrated in the table below:\nNumber of months of service completed\nPaid outpatient sick leave (days)\n3\n5\n4\n8\n5\n11\n6 and thereafter\n14\nIf you have served your employer for less than 3 months, you are not entitled to paid sick leave under the EA. However, some employers may provide medical benefits that exceed those stated in the EA. You should check your employment contract and/or handbook on these specific benefits.\nFurthermore, even if you are on probation, you will still be entitled to paid sick leave as long as you fall within the EA and your period of service is at least 3 months.\nWhat If You Run Out of Sick Leave?\nGenerally, if you have utilised all your sick leave entitlements and run out of sick leave, but are still feeling unwell or have a medical condition and require an extended period of rest, you may consider the following options:\nRequest to go on extended no-pay leave for an agreed period with your employer\nMake other working arrangements that are acceptable to you and your employer, e.g., reallocation of responsibilities and reducing workload, working from home\nObtain a medical assessment to see if you are suitable to continue with your current job scope and if any adjustments or accommodations can be made\nCan Your Employer Terminate You If You have Taken an Extended Amount of Sick Leave?\nGenerally, termination of employment should only be used as a last resort.\nHowever, employers may deem an employee to be too ill and unfit for the job, especially in situations where an extended amount of sick leave taken has adversely affected the company’s operations. For example, a nurse who has been diagnosed with a medical condition that renders him/her unable to walk for long hours or come in contact with other patients, and has to repeatedly take sick leave owing to the condition.\nIn such situations, the employer may terminate the employee’s employment after giving due notice or payment in lieu of notice.\nWhat can you do if you feel that your dismissal was wrongful?\nIf you are an employee covered by the EA and feel that you have been terminated unfairly, you may\nappeal in writing\nto the\nMinistry of Manpower\n. Alternatively, you can file a wrongful dismissal claim with\nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management\n(TADM). The claim to TADM has to be filed within 1 month from the last day of employment along with proof that your dismissal was wrongful.\nIf your wrongful dismissal claim cannot be resolved at TADM, it will be referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT). In the event that the ECT judges find the dismissal wrongful, your employer may be ordered to reinstate you to your former job and pay you any income loss due to the wrongful dismissal or pay you a sum of money as compensation.\nNote that managers and executives who are dismissed with notice or salary in lieu of notice can only file a wrongful dismissal claim if they have served their employer for at least 6 months.\n—\nAs an employee who has served your employer for a period of time and is covered by the EA, you are entitled to paid sick leave.\nYou may consult an\nemployment lawyer\nfor advice on your employment rights and determining your sick leave entitlements. If you are an employer, you can also seek advice on the obligations that you owe your employees in terms of their sick leave entitlements.\nEmployees who need scenario-based advice on the application of the EA or other employment laws may seek guidance from the\nTADM\nfor all employment disputes. Local low-wage workers may contact\nNTUC U Care Centre\nwhile NTUC union members may contact\nNTUC U PME Centre\n.\nTo recap, sick leave is an entitlement.

This article will help you know your rights and obligations as an employee when taking sick leave in Singapore. It will cover:\nWhat is Sick Leave?\nAn employee may be entitled to paid sick leave after examination by a medical practitioner and certification by that medical practitioner that the employee is unfit to work. This allows you to rest and recover before returning to work. The number of paid sick leave days that you are entitled to depends on the number of months of service completed.\nSick leave entitlements are governed by the\nEmployment Act\n(EA) which is Singapore’s main labour law. It provides for the basic terms and conditions at work for employees covered by the EA.\nThe main purpose of the EA is to safeguard employees’ working conditions and maintain good employment standards.\nWhat types of employees are covered by the Employment Act?\nThe EA generally covers an employee working under a contract of service with an employer and includes full-time, part-time, temporary and contract employees. The employee will be covered regardless of whether the employee is paid on an hourly, daily, monthly or piece-rated basis.\nThe EA does not make a distinction between local or foreign employees.\nThus, all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and non-citizens who work in Singapore will be covered by the EA. However, certain employees are excluded under the EA.\nIf an employee works less than 35 hours a week, they are part-time employees covered by the\nEmployment of Part-Time Employees Regulations\n. Self-employed persons, seafarers, domestic workers and statutory board employees are not covered by the EA.\nInstead, their employment terms will be set out in their employment contract.\nWho is Eligible For Sick Leave in Singapore?\nTo be eligible for sick leave, all of the following criteria have to be met:\nYou are covered under the Employment Act\nYou have served your employer for at least 3 months\nYou have informed or tried to inform your employer within 48 hours of your absence\nTo qualify for paid sick leave, you must be certified to be unfit for work by a medical practitioner registered under the Medical Registration Act or Dental Registration Act.\nIf you visited a Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner (TCMP), your employer may not recognise the medical certificates issued by TCMPs for the purpose of granting paid sick leave.\nEmployers are not required to grant paid sick leave or pay medical consultation fees for cosmetic procedures. If you are unsure of whether a procedure is cosmetic or not, you may consult the medical practitioner performing the medical examination who will determine the purpose of the procedure. Even if it is a cosmetic procedure, your company may cover this under the company’s internal policy.\nHowever, an employee is not eligible to apply for paid sick leave if they fall sick during:\nRest days: Employees have dedicated days of no work within a week. Your employer may prepare a monthly roster to inform you of the rest days before the start of each month\nPublic holidays: An employee under the EA is entitled to 11 gazetted public holidays in a year (e.g., New Year, Hari Raya, Christmas)\nNon-working days: For an employee with a 5-day work week, weekends are typically considered non-working days\nAnnual leave: Paid days of leave that an employee is entitled to within a year\nUnpaid leave: Days of leave that an employee takes without being paid a salary for the duration of the leave\nWhat are Your Sick Leave Entitlements?\nGenerally, the number of sick leave that you are entitled to is in accordance with the period of service with your employer. This is to ensure that the responsibilities placed on the employer are proportional to the length of service of the employee.\nThe period of service and the corresponding number of sick leave is illustrated in the table below:\nNumber of months of service completed\nPaid outpatient sick leave (days)\n3\n5\n4\n8\n5\n11\n6 and thereafter\n14\nIf you have served your employer for less than 3 months, you are not entitled to paid sick leave under the EA. However, some employers may provide medical benefits that exceed those stated in the EA. You should check your employment contract and/or handbook on these specific benefits.\nFurthermore, even if you are on probation, you will still be entitled to paid sick leave as long as you fall within the EA and your period of service is at least 3 months.\nWhat If You Run Out of Sick Leave?\nGenerally, if you have utilised all your sick leave entitlements and run out of sick leave, but are still feeling unwell or have a medical condition and require an extended period of rest, you may consider the following options:\nRequest to go on extended no-pay leave for an agreed period with your employer\nMake other working arrangements that are acceptable to you and your employer, e.g., reallocation of responsibilities and reducing workload, working from home\nObtain a medical assessment to see if you are suitable to continue with your current job scope and if any adjustments or accommodations can be made\nCan Your Employer Terminate You If You have Taken an Extended Amount of Sick Leave?\nGenerally, termination of employment should only be used as a last resort.\nHowever, employers may deem an employee to be too ill and unfit for the job, especially in situations where an extended amount of sick leave taken has adversely affected the company’s operations.

{"chunk_id": "SLA_020dc49e", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "A Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employer Obligations > A Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore", "text": "A Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nLast updated on November 26, 2024\nAll employees in Singapore are entitled to certain rights and benefits – leave entitlements are one of them.\nThere are two types of leave entitlements:\nStatutory; and\nNon-statutory.\nStatutory leave refers to compulsory leave entitlements that are provided for under the\nEmployment Act\n(EA). The EA is Singapore’s main labour law which provides for the basic terms and conditions at work for employees in Singapore.\nAll employees (including full-time, part-time, temporary, and contract employees) are protected under the EA.\nHowever, seafarers, domestic workers and statutory board employees are not covered under the EA. Instead, their employment terms/conditions (e.g. leave entitlements) are covered under other regulations and their respective employment contracts.\nSelf-employed persons are also not covered under the EA. Nevertheless, they are still eligible for child and adoption leave entitlements as this article will discuss.\nOn the other hand, non-statutory leave refers to non-mandatory entitlements that may be offered by some employers. These entitlements may also be dependent on the terms of your employment contract.\nIf you are an employee working in Singapore and are covered by the EA, read on to learn more about your leave entitlements. In this article, we will cover:\nA summary table of all statutory and non-statutory leave entitlements is available\nbelow\n.\nStatutory Leave Entitlements\nUnder the EA, employees are generally entitled to the following types of leave:\nAnnual Leave\nPublic Holidays and Off-in-Lieu\nGovernment-Paid Maternity Leave\nGovernment-Paid Paternity Leave\nShared Parental Leave\nGovernment-Paid Adoption Leave\nGovernment-Paid Childcare Leave\nUnpaid Infant Care Leave\nOutpatient Sick Leave and Hospitalisation Leave\nNational Service Leave\nAnnual leave\nAn employee that has worked for more than 3 months will be entitled to a minimum of 7 days of paid annual leave for the first year of service. You can only start applying for annual leave after working for 3 months.\nUnder the EA, the number of paid annual leave increases by one day per year of service, with the maximum capped at 14 days as illustrated in the table below.\nHowever, do note that the entitlement of up to 14 days of annual leave is only statutorily provided for, and employers are free to provide more days of annual leave (eg. up to 21/28 days) as part of their employment benefits.\nYear of service\nDays of leave\n1st\n7\n2nd\n8\n3rd\n9\n4th\n10\n5th\n11\n6th\n12\n7th\n13\n8th and thereafter\n14\nIf you have been employed with your current employer for at least 3 months but not the full 12 months in any year, your annual leave will be pro-rated accordingly.\nThis is also relevant if you intend to leave the company in the same year. For more information on how to calculate your pro-rated annual leave, please visit\nthe Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) website\n.\nPublic holidays and off-in-lieu\nEmployees are entitled to\n11 paid public holidays\nevery year. Should any gazetted public holiday fall on a rest day, the next working day will be a day off-in-lieu.\nA rest day refers to an unpaid non-working day determined by the employer (eg. Sunday or any other day of the week). Employers must provide at least 1 rest day per week.\nIf you are required to work on a public holiday, you are also entitled to either a day off-in-lieu\nor an extra day of salary\n.\nThe following formula may be used to calculate your public holiday pay falling on a working day or non-working day:\n(12 x Monthly basic rate of pay x Public holidays worked on) / (52 (number of weeks in a year) x Average number of work days in a week)\nFor instance, if you happen to work on National Day in August, have a monthly income of $3,000, and work an average of 5 days a week, your additional public holiday pay will be as follows:\n(12 x $3,000 x 1) / (52 x 5) = $138.46\nTo access the calculator and to find out more about your public holiday entitlements, you may wish to visit the MOM link\nhere\n.\nGovernment-Paid Maternity Leave (GPML)\nWorking mothers who have worked for at least 3 months will be entitled to either 16 weeks of maternity leave under the GPML scheme or 12 weeks of maternity leave, depending on whether the child is a Singapore citizen and other criteria.\nFor more information, please refer to our guide on\nmaternity leave entitlements in Singapore\n.\nGovernment-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL)\nEligible working fathers are entitled to 2 weeks of paternity leave. Optionally, employers can choose to grant an additional 2 weeks of GPPL which will be reimbursed by the Government. Hence, eligible working fathers can enjoy up to 4 weeks of leave, to be taken within 12 months from the child’s date of birth.\nRequirements would include serving the employer for at least 3 months, the child being a Singapore citizen, and being lawfully married to the child’s mother between conception and birth.\nFrom 1 April 2025, eligible working fathers are entitled to 4 weeks of paternity leave by default.\nFor more information about the eligibility criteria for GPPL, please refer to our guide on\npaternity leave in Singapore\n.\nGovernment-paid adoption leave (AL)\nEligible adoptive mothers are entitled to 12 weeks of paid adoption leave.\nTo be eligible, you must fulfil the following criteria:\nYour adopted child must be below 12 months old when you made your formal intent to adopt. The formal intent to adopt differs depending on whether your child is local (a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident)\nor foreign.\nFor a local child, the intent to adopt occurs when you file the court application to adopt.\nFor a foreign child, this occurs when the in-principle approval is granted for a Dependent’s Pass.\nYour adopted child is a Singapore citizen. However, if the child is a foreigner:\nOne of the adoptive parents must be a Singapore citizen; and\nThe child must become a Singapore citizen within 6 months of adoption\nYou must have served your employer or been self-employed for at least 3 months immediately before your formal intent to adopt.\nThe adoption order must also be passed within 1 year from the formal intent to adopt.\nUpon meeting the above requirements, the employer will pay for the 1st to 4th week of your AL, at your gross rate of pay; and the Government will reimburse/pay for the 5th to 12th week of your AL, capped at $10,000 per 4 weeks or a total of $20,000. Do take note that you must consume your adoption leave before the child’s first birthday.\nSimilar to GPML, up to 4 weeks of adoption leave can be shared with adoptive fathers.\nShared Parental Leave (SPL)\nIf you are a working father, you can also apply to share up to 4 weeks of your wife’s GPML or Adoption Leave (subject to your wife’s mutual agreement). The eligibility requirements are as follows:\nYour child must be a Singapore citizen;\nThe child’s mother must qualify for GPML/AL; and\nYou are lawfully married to the child’s mother.\nThe Government will reimburse all 4 weeks of SPL, capped at $2,500 per week or a total of $10,000 for 4 weeks.\nBetween 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026, eligible working parents can enjoy up to an additional 6 weeks of leave, to be shared between parents after their GPML/AL/GPPL is fully consumed.\nFor more information on SPLs and how to apply for them, you may refer to the MOM’s website\nhere\n.\nGovernment-paid childcare leave (GPCL)\nWorking parents of children who are Singapore citizens are entitled to 6 days of paid childcare leave per year.\nThe following are the eligibility requirements for this leave entitlement, as stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower:\nYour child is a Singaporean citizen;\nIf your child is a non-citizen, you are entitled to 2 days of childcare leave per year\nYour youngest child is below 7 years old; and\nYou have served your employer for at least 3 continuous months; for those who are self-employed, you must have been self-employed for at least 3 continuous months and have lost income during your childcare leave period.\nThe employer will pay for the 1st to 3rd day of your GPCL, at your gross rate of pay; and the Government will reimburse the 4th to 6th day of your GPCL, capped at $500 per day or a total of $1,500 in any calendar year.\nYou may wish to refer to this detailed guide for more information on\nchildcare leave in Singapore\n.\nIn addition, if your youngest child is in primary school, you are entitled to 2 days of\nextended childcare leave\n. The eligibility requirements that would need to be met are as follows:\nYour youngest child is between 7 and 12 years old (inclusive);\nYour child is a Singaporean citizen; and\nFor employees, you must have served your employer for at least 3 continuous months. For those who are self-employed, you must have been engaged in your work for a continuous period of at least 3 months, and have lost income during the childcare leave period.\nThe Government will reimburse all 2 days of your ECL, capped at $500 per day or a total of $1,000 in any calendar year.\nUnpaid infant care leave\nIn addition to paid childcare leave, you are also entitled to 12 days of unpaid infant care leave a year (regardless of the number of children) if you meet the following requirements:\nYour child (includes legally adopted children or step-children) is below 2 years old;\nYour child is a Singapore citizen; and\nYou have served your employer for at least 3 continuous months.\nOutpatient sick leave and hospitalisation leave\nEmployees are entitled to up to 14 days of paid outpatient sick leave and 60 days of paid hospitalisation leave. The number of days of leave entitlement would depend on your period of service (further elaborated below).\nTo be eligible for paid outpatient sick leave and hospitalisation leave, you must:\nBe covered under the EA;\nHave served your employer for at least 3 months; and\nHave informed or tried to inform your employer of your absence (i.e., on medical grounds) within 48 hours.\nFor paid sick leave, you must also provide your employer with a Medical Certificate certifying that you are unfit for work.\nAs for paid hospitalisation leave, you must be:\nWarded in a hospital (either public or private) for day surgery\nor\nquarantined under written law; and\nCertified by a medical practitioner from an approved medical centre, national specialty centre or ambulatory surgical centre.\nFor a complete list of MOM-approved hospitals, National Specialty Centres and Ambulatory Centres, please visit the link\nhere\n.\nIf you have served your employer for less than 6 months, your paid sick leave and hospitalisation leave will be pro-rated accordingly:\nNumber of months of service completed\nPaid outpatient sick leave (days)\nPaid hospitalisation leave (days)\n3\n5\n15\n4\n8\n30\n5\n11\n45\n6 and thereafter\n14\n60\nNational service leave\nUnder\nsection 23 of the Enlistment Act\n, your employer is obliged to provide you with paid leave of absence when you are called to perform National Service duties (eg. reservist and voluntary service).\nIn particular, your employer will be required to provide NS Make-Up Pay for the duration of any Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) activities in which you are required to participate. To illustrate, your NS pay is split into 2 components:\nService Pay\n: This refers to your full-time NS allowance (dependent on your rank and vocation) which will be pro-rated based on the duration of your ORNS activity.\nMake-Up Pay\n: This refers to the difference between your civilian income loss and your Service Pay for the duration of your ORNS activity. If you are an employee, how you claim the Make-Up Pay will depend on whether your employer is:\nRegistered with the Direct Reimbursement to Employers of Claims for NS Training (DIRECT) scheme\n: In this case, you are not required to submit a Make-Up Pay claim as your employer will provide your usual pay and claim reimbursement of the Service Pay from MINDEF.\nNot registered with the DIRECT scheme\n: Either you or your employer will have to initiate a claim for Make-Up Pay. If you are doing so, you have to access\nand complete the steps\nin the\nNS Portal\nbefore your employer endorses and submits the claim to MINDEF.\nNon-statutory Leave Entitlements\nApart from statutory leave entitlements, employers may choose to provide their employees with non-statutory leave entitlements.\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of non-statutory leave entitlements that some employers might provide:\nUnpaid leave/leave of absence\nSabbatical\nCompassionate/Bereavement Leave\nMarriage Leave\nStudy/Exam Leave\nBirthday Leave\nMental Health Day/Leave\nUnpaid leave/Leave of absence\nUnpaid leave refers to a period of absence that an employee takes without being paid a salary for the duration of the leave. Subject to your employer’s approval, you may apply for unpaid leave if you are not eligible for paid annual leave or have used up your paid annual leave.\nUnpaid leave may also be taken for a variety of reasons, such as dependent care and the continuation of education.\nUnpaid leave is not provided for under any statute in Singapore. Therefore, your employer will have the discretion to decide whether to grant, as well as dictate the maximum and minimum number of unpaid leave you are entitled to.\nSabbatical\nA sabbatical refers to a period in which employees take an extended break from work to pursue other personal and/or professional interests.\nCompanies may provide employees with sabbatical leave after a period of service (eg. one-month sabbatical after 5 continuous years of service).\nDepending on your employer, sabbatical leave may be fully paid, partially paid or unpaid.\nExamples of sabbaticals include taking time off to travel, write, volunteer, study or simply enjoying a well-deserved break after working for a number of years.\nCompassionate/Bereavement leave\nCompanies usually offer 2 to 3 days of paid compassionate/bereavement leave for employees when an immediate family member has passed away. The time off is typically used for grieving, attending or preparing for the funeral.\nImmediate family members would normally include parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, and in-laws. However, the exact scope and duration of the compassionate/bereavement leave would still depend on your company’s leave policy.\nMarriage leave\nMarriage leave is provided for employees who are getting married. This is granted at the company’s discretion and while it is usually paid, it may be partially paid or unpaid if the leave is for an extended period of time.\nYou may be expected to provide a copy of the Marriage Certificate to your employer to support such a leave application.\nStudy/Exam leave\nIn support of lifelong learning, many companies are also offering study/exam leave for employees to prepare or attend exams. This may range from a few days to a few weeks.\nBirthday leave\nDepending on your company, you may be granted 1 paid birthday leave to celebrate the occasion. Some organisations may even allow employees to take this day off before or after their birthday itself.\nMental health day/leave\nSome companies have started to include mental health days/leave for employees to reduce stress and burnout. Again, this leave entitlement would ultimately depend on your company’s leave policy. For instance, some companies have allowed employees to take mental health days without a medical certificate. Other companies may require you to take sick leave to address mental health concerns.\nSummary of Statutory and Non-statutory Leave Entitlements\nHere is a summary of both statutory and non-statutory leave entitlements as discussed above:\nStatutory Leave\nType of Leave\nEntitlement Period\nEligibility Requirement(s)/ Key Information\nAnnual Leave\n7-14 days (depending on the years of service and/or the number of months worked)\nEmployed for a minimum of 3 months\nPublic Holidays and Off-in-Lieu\nDuring public holidays\nIf you are required to work, your employer should grant extra pay/day off-in-lieu\nGovernment-Paid Maternity Leave\n12 or 16 weeks\nThe child is a Singapore citizen\nYou are legally married to the child’s father\nThe child was born on/after 1 Jan 2017\nEmployed/self-employed for 3 months\nYou may refer to this\nguide\nfor more details\nGovernment-Paid Paternity Leave\n2 or 4 weeks\nThe child is a Singapore citizen\nYou are legally married to the child’s mother\nEmployed/self-employed for 3 months\nYou may refer to this\nguide\nfor more details\nGovernment-Paid Adoption Leave / Shared Parental Leave\n12 weeks\nAdopted child below 12 months old during formal intent to adopt\nAdopted child is a Singapore citizen, if not:\nOne of the adoptive parents must be a Singapore citizen; and\nThe child must be a Singapore citizen within 6 months of adoption\nAdoption order passed within 1 year from formal intent to adopt\nGovernment-Paid Childcare Leave\n6 days\nThe child is a Singapore citizen\nYoungest child below 7 years old\nEmployed/self-employed for 3 months\nYou may refer to this\nguide\non childcare leave\nfor more details.\nUnpaid Infant Care Leave\n12 days\nThe child is a Singapore citizen\nThe child is below 2 years old\nEmployed/self-employed for 3 months\nOutpatient Sick Leave and Hospitalisation Leave\nUp to 14 days of sick leave\nUp to 60 days of hospitalisation leave\nFor sick leave: Provide your employer with an MC\nFor hospitalisation leave: Applicable if you are warded in a hospital for surgery/quarantined under any written law\nNational Service (NS) Leave\nFull duration of NS duties\nWhenever you are called to perform NS duties\nEmployer required to pay Make-Up Pay and process depends on whether your company is:\nRegistered with the DIRECT scheme: no further action is required\nNot registered with the DIRECT scheme: either you or your employer initiates a Make-Up claim\nNon-statutory Leave\nType of Leave\nEntitlement Period*\nKey Information\nUnpaid Leave/Leave of Absence\nDetermined by the employer\nPeriod of absence employee takes without pay\nSabbatical\nUsually 2 months to a year\nAn extended period of leave to pursue personal interests\nCompassionate/\nBereavement Leave\nUsually 2-3 days\nLeave for employees when an immediate family member has passed away\nMarriage Leave\nUsually 2-3 days\nLeave for employees getting married\nStudy/Exam Leave\nDetermined by the exam schedule, subject to the employer’s approval\nLeave for employees studying and working at the same time\nBirthday Leave\n1 day\nLeave provided for employees before/after/during their birthdays\nMental Health Day/Leave\nDetermined by the employer\nLeave provided for employees to unplug and recharge\n*\nSince these are non-statutory types of leave, the duration would vary from employer to employer.\n—\nAs an employer, it is important for you to be aware of the various statutory leave entitlements that you are required, by law, to provide to eligible employees.

The EA is Singapore’s main labour law which provides for the basic terms and conditions at work for employees in Singapore.\nAll employees (including full-time, part-time, temporary, and contract employees) are protected under the EA.\nHowever, seafarers, domestic workers and statutory board employees are not covered under the EA. Instead, their employment terms/conditions (e.g. leave entitlements) are covered under other regulations and their respective employment contracts.\nSelf-employed persons are also not covered under the EA. Nevertheless, they are still eligible for child and adoption leave entitlements as this article will discuss.\nOn the other hand, non-statutory leave refers to non-mandatory entitlements that may be offered by some employers. These entitlements may also be dependent on the terms of your employment contract.\nIf you are an employee working in Singapore and are covered by the EA, read on to learn more about your leave entitlements. In this article, we will cover:\nA summary table of all statutory and non-statutory leave entitlements is available\nbelow\n.\nStatutory Leave Entitlements\nUnder the EA, employees are generally entitled to the following types of leave:\nAnnual Leave\nPublic Holidays and Off-in-Lieu\nGovernment-Paid Maternity Leave\nGovernment-Paid Paternity Leave\nShared Parental Leave\nGovernment-Paid Adoption Leave\nGovernment-Paid Childcare Leave\nUnpaid Infant Care Leave\nOutpatient Sick Leave and Hospitalisation Leave\nNational Service Leave\nAnnual leave\nAn employee that has worked for more than 3 months will be entitled to a minimum of 7 days of paid annual leave for the first year of service. You can only start applying for annual leave after working for 3 months.\nUnder the EA, the number of paid annual leave increases by one day per year of service, with the maximum capped at 14 days as illustrated in the table below.\nHowever, do note that the entitlement of up to 14 days of annual leave is only statutorily provided for, and employers are free to provide more days of annual leave (eg. up to 21/28 days) as part of their employment benefits.\nYear of service\nDays of leave\n1st\n7\n2nd\n8\n3rd\n9\n4th\n10\n5th\n11\n6th\n12\n7th\n13\n8th and thereafter\n14\nIf you have been employed with your current employer for at least 3 months but not the full 12 months in any year, your annual leave will be pro-rated accordingly.\nThis is also relevant if you intend to leave the company in the same year. For more information on how to calculate your pro-rated annual leave, please visit\nthe Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) website\n.\nPublic holidays and off-in-lieu\nEmployees are entitled to\n11 paid public holidays\nevery year. Should any gazetted public holiday fall on a rest day, the next working day will be a day off-in-lieu.\nA rest day refers to an unpaid non-working day determined by the employer (eg. Sunday or any other day of the week). Employers must provide at least 1 rest day per week.\nIf you are required to work on a public holiday, you are also entitled to either a day off-in-lieu\nor an extra day of salary\n.\nThe following formula may be used to calculate your public holiday pay falling on a working day or non-working day:\n(12 x Monthly basic rate of pay x Public holidays worked on) / (52 (number of weeks in a year) x Average number of work days in a week)\nFor instance, if you happen to work on National Day in August, have a monthly income of $3,000, and work an average of 5 days a week, your additional public holiday pay will be as follows:\n(12 x $3,000 x 1) / (52 x 5) = $138.46\nTo access the calculator and to find out more about your public holiday entitlements, you may wish to visit the MOM link\nhere\n.\nGovernment-Paid Maternity Leave (GPML)\nWorking mothers who have worked for at least 3 months will be entitled to either 16 weeks of maternity leave under the GPML scheme or 12 weeks of maternity leave, depending on whether the child is a Singapore citizen and other criteria.\nFor more information, please refer to our guide on\nmaternity leave entitlements in Singapore\n.\nGovernment-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL)\nEligible working fathers are entitled to 2 weeks of paternity leave. Optionally, employers can choose to grant an additional 2 weeks of GPPL which will be reimbursed by the Government. Hence, eligible working fathers can enjoy up to 4 weeks of leave, to be taken within 12 months from the child’s date of birth.\nRequirements would include serving the employer for at least 3 months, the child being a Singapore citizen, and being lawfully married to the child’s mother between conception and birth.\nFrom 1 April 2025, eligible working fathers are entitled to 4 weeks of paternity leave by default.\nFor more information about the eligibility criteria for GPPL, please refer to our guide on\npaternity leave in Singapore\n.\nGovernment-paid adoption leave (AL)\nEligible adoptive mothers are entitled to 12 weeks of paid adoption leave.\nTo be eligible, you must fulfil the following criteria:\nYour adopted child must be below 12 months old when you made your formal intent to adopt. The formal intent to adopt differs depending on whether your child is local (a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident)\nor foreign.\nFor a local child, the intent to adopt occurs when you file the court application to adopt.\nFor a foreign child, this occurs when the in-principle approval is granted for a Dependent’s Pass.\nYour adopted child is a Singapore citizen. However, if the child is a foreigner:\nOne of the adoptive parents must be a Singapore citizen; and\nThe child must become a Singapore citizen within 6 months of adoption\nYou must have served your employer or been self-employed for at least 3 months immediately before your formal intent to adopt.\nThe adoption order must also be passed within 1 year from the formal intent to adopt.\nUpon meeting the above requirements, the employer will pay for the 1st to 4th week of your AL, at your gross rate of pay; and the Government will reimburse/pay for the 5th to 12th week of your AL, capped at $10,000 per 4 weeks or a total of $20,000. Do take note that you must consume your adoption leave before the child’s first birthday.\nSimilar to GPML, up to 4 weeks of adoption leave can be shared with adoptive fathers.\nShared Parental Leave (SPL)\nIf you are a working father, you can also apply to share up to 4 weeks of your wife’s GPML or Adoption Leave (subject to your wife’s mutual agreement). The eligibility requirements are as follows:\nYour child must be a Singapore citizen;\nThe child’s mother must qualify for GPML/AL; and\nYou are lawfully married to the child’s mother.\nThe Government will reimburse all 4 weeks of SPL, capped at $2,500 per week or a total of $10,000 for 4 weeks.\nBetween 1 April 2025 to 31 March 2026, eligible working parents can enjoy up to an additional 6 weeks of leave, to be shared between parents after their GPML/AL/GPPL is fully consumed.\nFor more information on SPLs and how to apply for them, you may refer to the MOM’s website\nhere\n.\nGovernment-paid childcare leave (GPCL)\nWorking parents of children who are Singapore citizens are entitled to 6 days of paid childcare leave per year.\nThe following are the eligibility requirements for this leave entitlement, as stipulated by the Ministry of Manpower:\nYour child is a Singaporean citizen;\nIf your child is a non-citizen, you are entitled to 2 days of childcare leave per year\nYour youngest child is below 7 years old; and\nYou have served your employer for at least 3 continuous months; for those who are self-employed, you must have been self-employed for at least 3 continuous months and have lost income during your childcare leave period.\nThe employer will pay for the 1st to 3rd day of your GPCL, at your gross rate of pay; and the Government will reimburse the 4th to 6th day of your GPCL, capped at $500 per day or a total of $1,500 in any calendar year.\nYou may wish to refer to this detailed guide for more information on\nchildcare leave in Singapore\n.\nIn addition, if your youngest child is in primary school, you are entitled to 2 days of\nextended childcare leave\n. The eligibility requirements that would need to be met are as follows:\nYour youngest child is between 7 and 12 years old (inclusive);\nYour child is a Singaporean citizen; and\nFor employees, you must have served your employer for at least 3 continuous months. For those who are self-employed, you must have been engaged in your work for a continuous period of at least 3 months, and have lost income during the childcare leave period.\nThe Government will reimburse all 2 days of your ECL, capped at $500 per day or a total of $1,000 in any calendar year.\nUnpaid infant care leave\nIn addition to paid childcare leave, you are also entitled to 12 days of unpaid infant care leave a year (regardless of the number of children) if you meet the following requirements:\nYour child (includes legally adopted children or step-children) is below 2 years old;\nYour child is a Singapore citizen; and\nYou have served your employer for at least 3 continuous months.\nOutpatient sick leave and hospitalisation leave\nEmployees are entitled to up to 14 days of paid outpatient sick leave and 60 days of paid hospitalisation leave. The number of days of leave entitlement would depend on your period of service (further elaborated below).\nTo be eligible for paid outpatient sick leave and hospitalisation leave, you must:\nBe covered under the EA;\nHave served your employer for at least 3 months; and\nHave informed or tried to inform your employer of your absence (i.e., on medical grounds) within 48 hours.\nFor paid sick leave, you must also provide your employer with a Medical Certificate certifying that you are unfit for work.\nAs for paid hospitalisation leave, you must be:\nWarded in a hospital (either public or private) for day surgery\nor\nquarantined under written law; and\nCertified by a medical practitioner from an approved medical centre, national specialty centre or ambulatory surgical centre.\nFor a complete list of MOM-approved hospitals, National Specialty Centres and Ambulatory Centres, please visit the link\nhere\n.\nIf you have served your employer for less than 6 months, your paid sick leave and hospitalisation leave will be pro-rated accordingly:\nNumber of months of service completed\nPaid outpatient sick leave (days)\nPaid hospitalisation leave (days)\n3\n5\n15\n4\n8\n30\n5\n11\n45\n6 and thereafter\n14\n60\nNational service leave\nUnder\nsection 23 of the Enlistment Act\n, your employer is obliged to provide you with paid leave of absence when you are called to perform National Service duties (eg. reservist and voluntary service).\nIn particular, your employer will be required to provide NS Make-Up Pay for the duration of any Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) activities in which you are required to participate. To illustrate, your NS pay is split into 2 components:\nService Pay\n: This refers to your full-time NS allowance (dependent on your rank and vocation) which will be pro-rated based on the duration of your ORNS activity.\nMake-Up Pay\n: This refers to the difference between your civilian income loss and your Service Pay for the duration of your ORNS activity. If you are an employee, how you claim the Make-Up Pay will depend on whether your employer is:\nRegistered with the Direct Reimbursement to Employers of Claims for NS Training (DIRECT) scheme\n: In this case, you are not required to submit a Make-Up Pay claim as your employer will provide your usual pay and claim reimbursement of the Service Pay from MINDEF.\nNot registered with the DIRECT scheme\n: Either you or your employer will have to initiate a claim for Make-Up Pay. If you are doing so, you have to access\nand complete the steps\nin the\nNS Portal\nbefore your employer endorses and submits the claim to MINDEF.\nNon-statutory Leave Entitlements\nApart from statutory leave entitlements, employers may choose to provide their employees with non-statutory leave entitlements.\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of non-statutory leave entitlements that some employers might provide:\nUnpaid leave/leave of absence\nSabbatical\nCompassionate/Bereavement Leave\nMarriage Leave\nStudy/Exam Leave\nBirthday Leave\nMental Health Day/Leave\nUnpaid leave/Leave of absence\nUnpaid leave refers to a period of absence that an employee takes without being paid a salary for the duration of the leave. Subject to your employer’s approval, you may apply for unpaid leave if you are not eligible for paid annual leave or have used up your paid annual leave.\nUnpaid leave may also be taken for a variety of reasons, such as dependent care and the continuation of education.\nUnpaid leave is not provided for under any statute in Singapore. Therefore, your employer will have the discretion to decide whether to grant, as well as dictate the maximum and minimum number of unpaid leave you are entitled to.\nSabbatical\nA sabbatical refers to a period in which employees take an extended break from work to pursue other personal and/or professional interests.\nCompanies may provide employees with sabbatical leave after a period of service (eg. one-month sabbatical after 5 continuous years of service).\nDepending on your employer, sabbatical leave may be fully paid, partially paid or unpaid.\nExamples of sabbaticals include taking time off to travel, write, volunteer, study or simply enjoying a well-deserved break after working for a number of years.\nCompassionate/Bereavement leave\nCompanies usually offer 2 to 3 days of paid compassionate/bereavement leave for employees when an immediate family member has passed away. The time off is typically used for grieving, attending or preparing for the funeral.\nImmediate family members would normally include parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, siblings, and in-laws. However, the exact scope and duration of the compassionate/bereavement leave would still depend on your company’s leave policy.\nMarriage leave\nMarriage leave is provided for employees who are getting married. This is granted at the company’s discretion and while it is usually paid, it may be partially paid or unpaid if the leave is for an extended period of time.\nYou may be expected to provide a copy of the Marriage Certificate to your employer to support such a leave application.\nStudy/Exam leave\nIn support of lifelong learning, many companies are also offering study/exam leave for employees to prepare or attend exams. This may range from a few days to a few weeks.\nBirthday leave\nDepending on your company, you may be granted 1 paid birthday leave to celebrate the occasion. Some organisations may even allow employees to take this day off before or after their birthday itself.\nMental health day/leave\nSome companies have started to include mental health days/leave for employees to reduce stress and burnout. Again, this leave entitlement would ultimately depend on your company’s leave policy. For instance, some companies have allowed employees to take mental health days without a medical certificate. Other companies may require you to take sick leave to address mental health concerns.\nSummary of Statutory and Non-statutory Leave Entitlements\nHere is a summary of both statutory and non-statutory leave entitlements as discussed above:\nStatutory Leave\nType of Leave\nEntitlement Period\nEligibility Requirement(s)/ Key Information\nAnnual Leave\n7-14 days (depending on the years of service and/or the number of months worked)\nEmployed for a minimum of 3 months\nPublic Holidays and Off-in-Lieu\nDuring public holidays\nIf you are required to work, your employer should grant extra pay/day off-in-lieu\nGovernment-Paid Maternity Leave\n12 or 16 weeks\nThe child is a Singapore citizen\nYou are legally married to the child’s father\nThe child was born on/after 1 Jan 2017\nEmployed/self-employed for 3 months\nYou may refer to this\nguide\nfor more details\nGovernment-Paid Paternity Leave\n2 or 4 weeks\nThe child is a Singapore citizen\nYou are legally married to the child’s mother\nEmployed/self-employed for 3 months\nYou may refer to this\nguide\nfor more details\nGovernment-Paid Adoption Leave / Shared Parental Leave\n12 weeks\nAdopted child below 12 months old during formal intent to adopt\nAdopted child is a Singapore citizen, if not:\nOne of the adoptive parents must be a Singapore citizen; and\nThe child must be a Singapore citizen within 6 months of adoption\nAdoption order passed within 1 year from formal intent to adopt\nGovernment-Paid Childcare Leave\n6 days\nThe child is a Singapore citizen\nYoungest child below 7 years old\nEmployed/self-employed for 3 months\nYou may refer to this\nguide\non childcare leave\nfor more details.\nUnpaid Infant Care Leave\n12 days\nThe child is a Singapore citizen\nThe child is below 2 years old\nEmployed/self-employed for 3 months\nOutpatient Sick Leave and Hospitalisation Leave\nUp to 14 days of sick leave\nUp to 60 days of hospitalisation leave\nFor sick leave: Provide your employer with an MC\nFor hospitalisation leave: Applicable if you are warded in a hospital for surgery/quarantined under any written law\nNational Service (NS) Leave\nFull duration of NS duties\nWhenever you are called to perform NS duties\nEmployer required to pay Make-Up Pay and process depends on whether your company is:\nRegistered with the DIRECT scheme: no further action is required\nNot registered with the DIRECT scheme: either you or your employer initiates a Make-Up claim\nNon-statutory Leave\nType of Leave\nEntitlement Period*\nKey Information\nUnpaid Leave/Leave of Absence\nDetermined by the employer\nPeriod of absence employee takes without pay\nSabbatical\nUsually 2 months to a year\nAn extended period of leave to pursue personal interests\nCompassionate/\nBereavement Leave\nUsually 2-3 days\nLeave for employees when an immediate family member has passed away\nMarriage Leave\nUsually 2-3 days\nLeave for employees getting married\nStudy/Exam Leave\nDetermined by the exam schedule, subject to the employer’s approval\nLeave for employees studying and working at the same time\nBirthday Leave\n1 day\nLeave provided for employees before/after/during their birthdays\nMental Health Day/Leave\nDetermined by the employer\nLeave provided for employees to unplug and recharge\n*\nSince these are non-statutory types of leave, the duration would vary from employer to employer.\n—\nAs an employer, it is important for you to be aware of the various statutory leave entitlements that you are required, by law, to provide to eligible employees.

Generally, CPF contributions are payable for part-time, casual or temporary employees who are:\nSingapore Citizens or Permanent Residents;\nEngaged under a contract of service; and\nEarning total wages of more than $50 per month.\nHowever, what most employers may be unaware of is that besides an employee’s salary, there are also other employee payments that are CPF-payable, such as allowances and cash gifts. This article will detail examples of such payments that are CPF-payable, including:\nYou may also wish to refer to our other article to get a general understanding of\nCPF contribution rates and more\n.\nWhat are the Common Types of Employee Payments That are CPF-Payable?\nAllowances\nAllowances are generally any cash payment that increases the salary of an employee and hence forms part of the employee’s salary.\nExamples of allowances that are CPF-payable include:\nMeal allowance –\nPayment to employees for them to use to purchase food.

He has been called for NS training for a period of 7 days in July, during which his service pay is $200. Over these 7 days, A suffered a loss in his civilian income as his training hours overlapped with his working hours. This loss amounts to $500 ($2,100 civilian income x (5 working days / 21 working days in July)).\nA, therefore, receives a make-up pay of $300 (loss in civilian income of $500 – service pay of $200). A’s employer will now have to pay CPF contributions (based on prevailing CPF rates) on A’s new total salary amount of $2,400, which is inclusive of the NS make-up pay ($2,100 civilian income + $300 make-up pay).\nShare options or stocks\nAny cash given to your employees for them to purchase share options or stocks in the company is CPF-payable.\nHowever, CPF contributions are not payable if the employees:\nReceive or sell the share options or stocks held in their names\n(e.g. any sale proceeds made from the sale of shares held in the employees’ name would not be CPF-payable as the shares belong to them and not the company)\nDid not receive any cash payments to purchase the share options or stocks\n(e.g. they may have been given a discount to purchase the shares instead)\nExpenses and benefits\nAny cash given or reimbursement made to your employees for certain forms of expenses and benefits may or may not be CPF-payable depending on the types of expenses\n:\nExpenses\nAre these CPF-payable?\nWhen are they not CPF-payable?\nMobile phone expenses\nYes\nMobile phone expenses incurred for official purposes on behalf of the employer, as well as phone usage charges paid to the service provider are not CPF-payable.\nTransport expenses\nYes\nReimbursement for travel between the home and workplace or to another place of assignment in the line of official duty, as well as for transport expenses obliged to be paid for by the employer, are not CPF-payable.\nNote: Generally, any reimbursements made for official purposes (i.e. in the line of work) are not CPF-payable.\nFlexible benefit expenses\nAre these CPF-payable?\nWhen are they not CPF-payable?\nHoliday expenses, including any reimbursement for holiday expenses incurred by employees and any holiday benefits incurred by employees’ dependants, e.g. spouse.\nYes\nNot applicable.\nReimbursements of medical and dental treatment expenses incurred by employees, their spouses and/or children (whether in Singapore or overseas).\nNo\nCPF is not payable if the medical or dental treatment is considered necessary by registered doctors, TCM practitioners, and/or dentist for the treatment or diagnosis of any illness. However, if the employee is seeking such treatment of other own accord or to address aesthetic concerns, then CPF contributions\nare\npayable.\nEncashment\nEncashment refers to the process of converting an employee’s unutilised leave or benefits into cash. It is one way employers can allow their employees to consume their leave or benefits as opposed to having their employees forfeit them or take block leaves (i.e. a period of leave that can range from a week to a few months).\nCash paid to your employees for encashment of their leave and/or of flexible benefits is CPF-payable.\n—\nThis article has provided employers with an overview of payments that are CPF-payable, ranging from allowances to encashment.

Factors affecting an employee’s salary may include his/her education level, years of work experience as well as performance reviews.\nHowever, you will most definitely have to take into account the presence of any minimum wage laws, if applicable, as they stipulate the minimum amount that you will have to pay your employees in Singapore.\nThis article will discuss:\nWhat is a Minimum Wage?\nA minimum wage is defined as the lowest amount of remuneration that you, as an employer, have to pay an employee for work performed in a given period. It is not the wage that employees may think they are entitled to based on their work performance or the market rate for their role. A minimum wage is mandated by law.\nAn advantage of having a minimum wage is that employees can be protected against exploitation and unduly low pay. When employees are assured of receiving a minimum wage, they are more likely to remain at their current jobs. This in turn benefits employers as turnover rates decrease, and disruptions to work are minimised. Employers also do not have to spend more resources and effort to hire replacement workers.\nDoes Singapore have Minimum Wage Laws?\nGenerally, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) does not prescribe minimum wages for all employees in Singapore. The MOM has stated that wages are best determined by market demand and supply for labour. Employees should thus be paid based on their skills, capabilities and competencies.\nHowever, Singapore adopts the Progressive Wage Model (PWM), which prescribes minimum wages for certain economic sectors.\nWhat is the Progressive Wage Model (PWM)?\nThe PWM prescribes a minimum wage to be paid to employees in specific economic sectors. The “wage” referred to by the PWM is the basic monthly salary. It is a figure that the employee receives without factoring in bonuses, overtime pay or any other extra compensation.\nThe PWM further mandates that the minimum wage to be paid under it is to be raised as employees upgrade their skills and increase productivity. In certain sectors, wages had stagnated due to widespread practices of hiring cheap labour. The PWM thus allows low-wage workers to enjoy a decent living wage and salary growth.\nEmployers can also stand to benefit from the PWM as workers become incentivised to upgrade their skills and increase their productivity, which potentially leads to increased business profits.\nWho is Covered Under the Progressive Wage Model?\nSingaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs) working in the cleaning and security sectors, as well as in landscape companies on NParks’ Landscape Company Register, are covered under the PWM.\nFrom 2022 to 2023, the PWM was expanded to cover workers in more sectors such as retail, food services and waste management. Drivers and administrative assistants, regardless of which sector they work in, are also covered under the PWM.\nThe PWM applies not just to full-time employees, but also part-time and temporary employees. The wages of part-time employees will be pro-rated based on the basic PWM wage paid to a full-time employee with a similar job scope. This means that they will receive basic PWM wages that have been adjusted proportionately based on the number of hours they have worked relative to a full-time employee.\nWhat is the Minimum Wage Under the Progressive Wage Model in Singapore?\nThe minimum wage for each sector under the PWM is\nmandatory\n. It is, however, not standardised and there may be different wage ladders for different categories of jobs within each sector. The minimum wage amount for each sector also\nincreases over time\n.\nFor example, in-house cleaners as well as general cleaners who work at office and commercial sites, and in F&B establishments, must be paid a minimum basic salary of $1,740 while general cleaners working in conservancies (e.g. town councils) will have to be paid at least $2,060, from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025. Over the following year, from 1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026, their minimum wages will be increased to $1,910 and $2,325 respectively.\nThe minimum wage will increase as employees undergo training and take on roles that require higher-value skills. For instance, as cleaners in conservancies get promoted to refuse collectors, their minimum basic salary rises to $2,270 from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025. This amount increases to $2,455 if they become supervisors, and further increases to $2,620 if they become truck drivers.\nFurthermore, a PWM Bonus is payable to eligible employees on top of their wages. Employees in the cleaning sector must be paid a PWM bonus of at least 2 weeks of their basic monthly salary while employees in the waste management sector must be paid a PWM bonus of at least 1 month of their basic monthly salary. Employees may be eligible for this bonus if they have worked for the same business for at least 12 months. For eligible part-time employees, this bonus will also be pro-rated.\nYou may refer to\nMOM’s website\nfor more information on the prescribed minimum wages by PWM.\nWhat are Some Other Obligations of Employers Under the Progressive Wage Model?\nUnder the PWM, employees will have to meet certain training requirements for upgrading their skills and increasing their productivity. When they have met these training requirements, they will also have to be paid a higher wage.\nEmployers like yourself will have to ensure that employees are able to meet the PWM training requirements, such as by sending your employees to various courses to obtain certain qualifications. You may tap on the\nWorkfare Skills Support\nto subsidise training costs for your Singaporean employees.\nAdditionally, the government is co-funding eligible wage increases given to lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme until 2026. This scheme provides transitional wage support for employers to adjust to upcoming mandatory wage increases for lower-wage workers covered by the PWM, and employers can expect a payout for the respective year.\nYou may refer to\nMOM’s website\nfor more information on the specific PWM training requirements.\nWhat are the Consequences of Not Abiding by the Progressive Wage Model?\nFailure to comply with the PWM, such as by not paying the minimum wage or bonuses under the PWM to eligible employees, can constitute a breach of the licensing conditions that businesses need to adhere to in order to operate in sectors covered by the PWM.\nIf you are found to have committed such breaches, you may receive warning letters or even be fined. (The maximum fine for breaches of licensing conditions in the cleaning sector is $5,000, for example.) In severe cases, you also risk having your licence suspended or revoked.\nOther Minimum Wage Requirements that Employers Should be Aware of\nApart from the PWM, there is also another requirement that you ought to take note of when determining an employee’s salary. In Singapore, firms that hire foreign workers are to pay their Singaporean and Permanent Resident employees a Local Qualifying Salary (LQS) of at least $1,600 a month for full-timers and $10.50 an hour for part-timers.\nThe government has reiterated that the LQS is not a minimum wage. Rather, it is a threshold imposed on firms to prevent resident employees from being hired on token salaries to provide the employer with access to foreign workers.\n—\nTo sum up, Singapore adopts a PWM as opposed to a traditional minimum wage policy to uplift low-wage employees in certain sectors, such as cleaning and security. As the PWM continues to expand to cover more sectors, more employees will be able to benefit from increased wages. Businesses will also stand to benefit from the employees’ increased productivity as they undergo training required by the PWM and become more skilled.\nFor sectors covered by the PWM, compliance with the PWM is mandatory. It is important that employers comply with all requirements to ensure that their business licences will not be revoked.\nApart from such minimum wage obligations, employers will also face other employment law obligations regarding paid leave, overtime compensation, working hours and so on. It is therefore recommended that you hire an employment lawyer if you need help understanding your employment obligations.\nA lawyer who is well-versed in employment law can help ensure that your business complies with your obligations under the PWM as well as other employment laws in Singapore.\nYou may get in touch with experienced employment lawyers here.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Factors affecting an employee’s salary may include his/her education level, years of work experience as well as performance reviews.\nHowever, you will most definitely have to take into account the presence of any minimum wage laws, if applicable, as they stipulate the minimum amount that you will have to pay your employees in Singapore.\nThis article will discuss:\nWhat is a Minimum Wage?\nA minimum wage is defined as the lowest amount of remuneration that you, as an employer, have to pay an employee for work performed in a given period. It is not the wage that employees may think they are entitled to based on their work performance or the market rate for their role. A minimum wage is mandated by law.\nAn advantage of having a minimum wage is that employees can be protected against exploitation and unduly low pay. When employees are assured of receiving a minimum wage, they are more likely to remain at their current jobs. This in turn benefits employers as turnover rates decrease, and disruptions to work are minimised. Employers also do not have to spend more resources and effort to hire replacement workers.\nDoes Singapore have Minimum Wage Laws?\nGenerally, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) does not prescribe minimum wages for all employees in Singapore. The MOM has stated that wages are best determined by market demand and supply for labour. Employees should thus be paid based on their skills, capabilities and competencies.\nHowever, Singapore adopts the Progressive Wage Model (PWM), which prescribes minimum wages for certain economic sectors.\nWhat is the Progressive Wage Model (PWM)?\nThe PWM prescribes a minimum wage to be paid to employees in specific economic sectors. The “wage” referred to by the PWM is the basic monthly salary. It is a figure that the employee receives without factoring in bonuses, overtime pay or any other extra compensation.\nThe PWM further mandates that the minimum wage to be paid under it is to be raised as employees upgrade their skills and increase productivity. In certain sectors, wages had stagnated due to widespread practices of hiring cheap labour. The PWM thus allows low-wage workers to enjoy a decent living wage and salary growth.\nEmployers can also stand to benefit from the PWM as workers become incentivised to upgrade their skills and increase their productivity, which potentially leads to increased business profits.\nWho is Covered Under the Progressive Wage Model?\nSingaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs) working in the cleaning and security sectors, as well as in landscape companies on NParks’ Landscape Company Register, are covered under the PWM.\nFrom 2022 to 2023, the PWM was expanded to cover workers in more sectors such as retail, food services and waste management. Drivers and administrative assistants, regardless of which sector they work in, are also covered under the PWM.\nThe PWM applies not just to full-time employees, but also part-time and temporary employees. The wages of part-time employees will be pro-rated based on the basic PWM wage paid to a full-time employee with a similar job scope. This means that they will receive basic PWM wages that have been adjusted proportionately based on the number of hours they have worked relative to a full-time employee.\nWhat is the Minimum Wage Under the Progressive Wage Model in Singapore?\nThe minimum wage for each sector under the PWM is\nmandatory\n. It is, however, not standardised and there may be different wage ladders for different categories of jobs within each sector. The minimum wage amount for each sector also\nincreases over time\n.\nFor example, in-house cleaners as well as general cleaners who work at office and commercial sites, and in F&B establishments, must be paid a minimum basic salary of $1,740 while general cleaners working in conservancies (e.g. town councils) will have to be paid at least $2,060, from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025. Over the following year, from 1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026, their minimum wages will be increased to $1,910 and $2,325 respectively.\nThe minimum wage will increase as employees undergo training and take on roles that require higher-value skills. For instance, as cleaners in conservancies get promoted to refuse collectors, their minimum basic salary rises to $2,270 from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025. This amount increases to $2,455 if they become supervisors, and further increases to $2,620 if they become truck drivers.\nFurthermore, a PWM Bonus is payable to eligible employees on top of their wages. Employees in the cleaning sector must be paid a PWM bonus of at least 2 weeks of their basic monthly salary while employees in the waste management sector must be paid a PWM bonus of at least 1 month of their basic monthly salary. Employees may be eligible for this bonus if they have worked for the same business for at least 12 months. For eligible part-time employees, this bonus will also be pro-rated.\nYou may refer to\nMOM’s website\nfor more information on the prescribed minimum wages by PWM.\nWhat are Some Other Obligations of Employers Under the Progressive Wage Model?\nUnder the PWM, employees will have to meet certain training requirements for upgrading their skills and increasing their productivity. When they have met these training requirements, they will also have to be paid a higher wage.\nEmployers like yourself will have to ensure that employees are able to meet the PWM training requirements, such as by sending your employees to various courses to obtain certain qualifications. You may tap on the\nWorkfare Skills Support\nto subsidise training costs for your Singaporean employees.\nAdditionally, the government is co-funding eligible wage increases given to lower-wage workers through the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme until 2026. This scheme provides transitional wage support for employers to adjust to upcoming mandatory wage increases for lower-wage workers covered by the PWM, and employers can expect a payout for the respective year.\nYou may refer to\nMOM’s website\nfor more information on the specific PWM training requirements.\nWhat are the Consequences of Not Abiding by the Progressive Wage Model?\nFailure to comply with the PWM, such as by not paying the minimum wage or bonuses under the PWM to eligible employees, can constitute a breach of the licensing conditions that businesses need to adhere to in order to operate in sectors covered by the PWM.\nIf you are found to have committed such breaches, you may receive warning letters or even be fined. (The maximum fine for breaches of licensing conditions in the cleaning sector is $5,000, for example.) In severe cases, you also risk having your licence suspended or revoked.\nOther Minimum Wage Requirements that Employers Should be Aware of\nApart from the PWM, there is also another requirement that you ought to take note of when determining an employee’s salary. In Singapore, firms that hire foreign workers are to pay their Singaporean and Permanent Resident employees a Local Qualifying Salary (LQS) of at least $1,600 a month for full-timers and $10.50 an hour for part-timers.\nThe government has reiterated that the LQS is not a minimum wage. Rather, it is a threshold imposed on firms to prevent resident employees from being hired on token salaries to provide the employer with access to foreign workers.\n—\nTo sum up, Singapore adopts a PWM as opposed to a traditional minimum wage policy to uplift low-wage employees in certain sectors, such as cleaning and security. As the PWM continues to expand to cover more sectors, more employees will be able to benefit from increased wages. Businesses will also stand to benefit from the employees’ increased productivity as they undergo training required by the PWM and become more skilled.\nFor sectors covered by the PWM, compliance with the PWM is mandatory. It is important that employers comply with all requirements to ensure that their business licences will not be revoked.\nApart from such minimum wage obligations, employers will also face other employment law obligations regarding paid leave, overtime compensation, working hours and so on. It is therefore recommended that you hire an employment lawyer if you need help understanding your employment obligations.\nA lawyer who is well-versed in employment law can help ensure that your business complies with your obligations under the PWM as well as other employment laws in Singapore.\nYou may get in touch with experienced employment lawyers here.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Apart from the term “work-life balance”, there is also another term called “work-life harmony”, which refers to the state where an individual is able to achieve both professional and personal goals. In the working world, work-life balance policies are often used to achieve this.\nThis article seeks to explain the rationale behind work-life policies, introduce the existing work-life balance regime in Singapore and provide some recommendations that you, as an employer, could adopt for your business. It will cover:\nWhy Implement Work-Life Balance Policies?\nWork-life balance policies could range from flexible working arrangements, such as working from home, to including leave schemes for employees (more on this below).\nOn that note, a work-life balance policy will be highly beneficial not just to employees but employers as well.\nFor example, when employees work from home, their transportation time will be reduced. This means that employees can spend the additional time with their friends and families, pursue their own activities or hobbies or have more rest. Employees will therefore experience greater comfort and well-being, thereby alleviating stress and preventing burn-out.\nIn turn, their efficiency and productivity will likely be increased as employees find themselves having more energy and motivation to work. This debunks the popular myth that more time at work means more work is done. The reality is the contrary – more time spent at work does not necessarily equate to more work being done.\nFurthermore, employees with good work-life balance may also be more committed as they may not have to compromise their personal goals for professional ones. This can reduce absenteeism and employee turnover, in turn helping employers maintain a stable and trained workforce.\nOrganisations that implement work-life balance policies will also become more attractive to talent who appreciate that their well-being is prioritised.\nIs It Compulsory for Employers to Implement Work-Life Balance Policies?\nThere is currently no law mandating work-life balance policies. However, Singapore’s main labour law – the Employment Act (EA) – provides for the basic terms and working conditions for\nemployees covered under the EA\n. Some of these terms help facilitate work-life balance for employees, such as entitling them to a certain number of days off every year in the form of days off on public holidays, annual leave and sick leave.\nThere are also additional provisions under the EA that apply to certain types of employees, and help them further achieve better work-life balance:\nWorkers who are at least partly engaged in manual labour and earn a monthly base salary of below $4,500, and employees (who are not workmen or in a managerial or executive position) with a monthly base salary of below $2,600, have special entitlements under the EA. These entitlements include a weekly rest day, a limit on the number of hours of work per day, week or month and overtime pay.\nFemale employees who are pregnant or have given birth are entitled to\npaid maternity leave\n. There is also a prohibition on dismissal during their period of absence.\nEmployees who are parents and who have worked for their employers for at least 3 months are entitled to at least 2 days of\npaid annual childcare leave\nif they have children under 7 years of age.\nChildren (i.e. persons who are below 15, but above the\nminimum age of 13\n) and young persons (i.e. persons above 15 but below 16) are not allowed to work for more than a certain number of hours per day. They are also entitled to a break if work exceeds a certain number of hours, not including other restrictions on their location and conditions for work under the Employment (Children and Young Persons) Regulations.\nHow Can Employers Implement Better Work-Life Balance Policies in the Office?\nThe above legal obligations stipulated by law are only the minimum that employers must adhere to. However, as seen earlier, there are compelling reasons to improve the work-life balance policies in your organisation.\nIf you would like to go above and beyond and implement additional work-life balance policies or improve the existing work-life balance policies for your employees, you could refer to the guidelines provided by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP).\nThe TAFEP was established by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), National Trade Unions Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) with the purpose of helping employers to build successful workplaces where employees are respected, valued and able to achieve their fullest potential.\nOne initiative by the TAFEP that may be of help to employers seeking to implement or improve work-life balance policies for their employees is the releasing of the Tripartite Standard on Work-Life Harmony.\nThe Tripartite Standard on Work-Life Harmony is part of a new initiative by TAFEP that provides a list of progressive and practical steps that employers can take to improve work-life balance. The list includes recommendations on:\nFlexible working arrangements\n;\nLeave schemes\n; and\nEmployment support schemes\n.\nFlexible work arrangements\nFlexible work arrangements refer to alternative arrangements that involve deviations from the typical or traditional working constraints like strict schedules or locations. Some examples could include working from home or allowing employees to take off-days on weekdays instead of weekends or public holidays.\nThe benefits of flexible work arrangements lie not only in the flexibility of location, but also the working hours and workload. With flexible work arrangements, employees will be able to allocate time more efficiently for their work and non-work tasks, including completing house chores and helping family members. This will help employees focus during their work as they are less likely to be distracted by how they are going to complete their non-work tasks.\nApart from the increased employee comfort provided by offering flexible work locations, hours and workloads, implementing flexible work arrangements also helps employers to be prepared in case crisis events or emergencies that may require remote working occur. For example, if employees are unable to go to the office due to a pandemic or security lockdown.\nSingapore has introduced a new Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests (TG-FWAR). It is intended to shape the right norms and expectations around requesting flexible work arrangements in Singapore.\nUnder the TG-FWAR, all employees who have successfully completed their probation are entitled to submit a flexible work arrangement request. While the TG-FWAR does not require employers to offer flexible work arrangements to employees, employers are required to consider such requests in a reasonable manner.\nHence, if you are concerned about the possible downsides of flexible work arrangements, you could consider starting with a trial. You could also communicate your expectations clearly and upfront so that your employees can know what they are and meet them. However, you must not reject employees’ flexible work arrangement requests based on personal bias against flexible work arrangements.\nThe TG-FWAR took effect on 1 December 2024.\nFor more information, you may refer to our article on\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Guidelines on Flexi-Work Requests\n.\nYou may also read our other articles to learn more about implementing\nWork From Home policies in Singapore\nand\nhiring remote employees\n.\nLeave schemes\nEmployers can also consider offering additional leave schemes beyond what is mandated by law. Such leave might be paid or unpaid. There could be compassionate leave, eldercare sick leave, leave for special occasions with children and/or marriage leave. To boost morale among employees, there could also be birthday leaves, personal days off and study and exam leave.\nMore generous leave schemes provide employees with an avenue to fulfil their personal goals. This translates to your employees having greater satisfaction with their jobs.\nThe happier and more satisfied your employees are, the more motivated and hence productive they may be at work. They may also perceive that their employers understand their needs and therefore become more loyal to your business. This will certainly help your business in the long run.\nEmployment support schemes\nEmployers can also consider implementing employment support schemes. Such schemes help employees manage the aspects of their lives beyond just work and may better motivate and engage employees at their workplace. These schemes may include offering:\nFamily-related gifts, subsidies and services:\nGifts in the form of hampers, vouchers, cash or red packets could be given to employees when they are sick, hospitalised, getting married, pregnant or if they have given birth recently. This will encourage employees by showing them that their employer cares for them beyond their work.\nHealth-related benefits:\nThese might include subsidised health screening, gym memberships or mental wellness benefits like counselling or mentorship programmes. Healthy food like fruits could also be given to employees. Such health-related benefits will generally boost the health and fitness levels of employees. Improvements in your employees’ physical, mental and emotional health can help enhance their stamina and concentration and also allow them to worry less about their health. This may lead to higher and/or better work output.\nSocial/recreational activities or areas:\nThese could include company outings for birthdays or anniversaries or creating employee lounges. These social activities or areas could help employees relieve stress and foster bonding among employees, which allows them to become more motivated and cohesive as a working unit.\nA management member could also be appointed to advocate for work-life balance. He/she may also review the effectiveness of their measures via surveys or focus group discussions.\nGovernment Support for Helping Employers Implement Work-Life Balance Policies\nEmployers looking for government support in implementing work-life balance policies can consider applying for the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG).\nThe PSG is a scheme administered by Enterprise SG that supports Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) looking to enhance their business processes by adopting certain IT solutions and equipment. With the grant, businesses may be able to invest in online collaboration tools that facilitate remote working arrangements.\nYou may learn more about the scheme on the\nEnterprise SG website\n.\n—\nWhile a “perfect” work-life balance may not exist, little changes can go a long way. Ultimately, implementing work-life balance policies might be one of the best investments for your business.\nRegardless of whether you are looking to ensure compliance with the existing legal requirements for facilitating work-life balance in Singapore or seeking to implement new work-life balance policies, consulting an employment lawyer may be helpful.\nThe employment lawyer will be able to consider the legal obligations pertaining to work-life balance under the EA that your business must meet. He/she will also be able to take into consideration the human resource needs of your business and advise you on the most effective measures to help your employees achieve optimal (or, at the very least, adequate) work-life balance.\nYou may get in touch with experienced employment lawyers in Singapore here.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

This will help employees focus during their work as they are less likely to be distracted by how they are going to complete their non-work tasks.\nApart from the increased employee comfort provided by offering flexible work locations, hours and workloads, implementing flexible work arrangements also helps employers to be prepared in case crisis events or emergencies that may require remote working occur. For example, if employees are unable to go to the office due to a pandemic or security lockdown.\nSingapore has introduced a new Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests (TG-FWAR). It is intended to shape the right norms and expectations around requesting flexible work arrangements in Singapore.\nUnder the TG-FWAR, all employees who have successfully completed their probation are entitled to submit a flexible work arrangement request. While the TG-FWAR does not require employers to offer flexible work arrangements to employees, employers are required to consider such requests in a reasonable manner.\nHence, if you are concerned about the possible downsides of flexible work arrangements, you could consider starting with a trial. You could also communicate your expectations clearly and upfront so that your employees can know what they are and meet them. However, you must not reject employees’ flexible work arrangement requests based on personal bias against flexible work arrangements.\nThe TG-FWAR took effect on 1 December 2024.\nFor more information, you may refer to our article on\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Guidelines on Flexi-Work Requests\n.\nYou may also read our other articles to learn more about implementing\nWork From Home policies in Singapore\nand\nhiring remote employees\n.\nLeave schemes\nEmployers can also consider offering additional leave schemes beyond what is mandated by law. Such leave might be paid or unpaid. There could be compassionate leave, eldercare sick leave, leave for special occasions with children and/or marriage leave. To boost morale among employees, there could also be birthday leaves, personal days off and study and exam leave.\nMore generous leave schemes provide employees with an avenue to fulfil their personal goals. This translates to your employees having greater satisfaction with their jobs.\nThe happier and more satisfied your employees are, the more motivated and hence productive they may be at work. They may also perceive that their employers understand their needs and therefore become more loyal to your business. This will certainly help your business in the long run.\nEmployment support schemes\nEmployers can also consider implementing employment support schemes. Such schemes help employees manage the aspects of their lives beyond just work and may better motivate and engage employees at their workplace. These schemes may include offering:\nFamily-related gifts, subsidies and services:\nGifts in the form of hampers, vouchers, cash or red packets could be given to employees when they are sick, hospitalised, getting married, pregnant or if they have given birth recently. This will encourage employees by showing them that their employer cares for them beyond their work.\nHealth-related benefits:\nThese might include subsidised health screening, gym memberships or mental wellness benefits like counselling or mentorship programmes. Healthy food like fruits could also be given to employees. Such health-related benefits will generally boost the health and fitness levels of employees. Improvements in your employees’ physical, mental and emotional health can help enhance their stamina and concentration and also allow them to worry less about their health. This may lead to higher and/or better work output.\nSocial/recreational activities or areas:\nThese could include company outings for birthdays or anniversaries or creating employee lounges. These social activities or areas could help employees relieve stress and foster bonding among employees, which allows them to become more motivated and cohesive as a working unit.\nA management member could also be appointed to advocate for work-life balance. He/she may also review the effectiveness of their measures via surveys or focus group discussions.\nGovernment Support for Helping Employers Implement Work-Life Balance Policies\nEmployers looking for government support in implementing work-life balance policies can consider applying for the Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG).\nThe PSG is a scheme administered by Enterprise SG that supports Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) looking to enhance their business processes by adopting certain IT solutions and equipment. With the grant, businesses may be able to invest in online collaboration tools that facilitate remote working arrangements.\nYou may learn more about the scheme on the\nEnterprise SG website\n.\n—\nWhile a “perfect” work-life balance may not exist, little changes can go a long way. Ultimately, implementing work-life balance policies might be one of the best investments for your business.\nRegardless of whether you are looking to ensure compliance with the existing legal requirements for facilitating work-life balance in Singapore or seeking to implement new work-life balance policies, consulting an employment lawyer may be helpful.\nThe employment lawyer will be able to consider the legal obligations pertaining to work-life balance under the EA that your business must meet. He/she will also be able to take into consideration the human resource needs of your business and advise you on the most effective measures to help your employees achieve optimal (or, at the very least, adequate) work-life balance.\nYou may get in touch with experienced employment lawyers in Singapore here.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Apart from the recommendations, the tripartite advisory also contains resources for employers to utilise.\nIs It Compulsory for Employers to Implement the Recommendations?\nThe recommendations are intended to outline certain practices and measures employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being and are not meant to be legally binding on employers.\nWhile it is therefore not compulsory for employers to implement the recommendations, they are strongly encouraged to do so for the purpose of promoting employee mental well-being at the workplace.\nRecommendations in the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-Being at Workplaces\nThe tripartite advisory comprehensively sets out the recommendations and practices to be applied on three levels:\nThe individual employees\nTeam/department level\nOrganisational level\nIndividual employees\nAppointing mental wellness champions\nTo support individual employees, employers may consider appointing mental wellness champions to raise employees’ awareness on mental health by organising workshops or talks.\nThrough these programmes, employees will be exposed to mental well-being related issues, such as mental health conditions and coping methods.\nProvide access to counselling services\nEmployers may also consider providing employees access to counselling services, so that they are able to speak to a professional on their work and non-work related issues.\nThe tripartite advisory contains a list of service providers employers may tap on to provide such access to their employees, such as the Singapore Anglican Community Services Integrated Employment Services, Singapore Counselling Centre and Mind What Matters.\nExtend the scope of employee benefits\nEmployers are also encouraged to extend the scope of existing flexible employee benefits to include mental health consultations and treatments, as well as mental well-being programmes.\nTeam/department level\nTrain key personnel to detect mental distress and direct employees to seek help\nKey personnel members of companies, such as managers, supervisors or union leaders, could be trained to detect signs of mental distress, and intervene accordingly to refer employees to seek professional help.\nEmployers may consider utilising the\nresources listed in the tripartite advisory\n(under “Annex A”) to equip these members with the relevant skills.\nFor instance, employers and key personnel members of the company may wish to participate in Health Promotion Board’s Wellbeing@Work workshop that covers topics such as recognising mental health issues, or engage mental health training services from the Singapore Anglican Community Services that equips employers and supervisors with knowledge and skills on caring for the mental well-being of their employees.\nStrengthen the social support system at the workplace\nHaving a strong social support system will go hand-in-hand with the safeguarding of mental well-being.\nAs a result, employers are encouraged to organise bonding activities, and/or put in place internal systems to form strong support networks within the team/ departments.\nPromote a psychologically safe and trusting work environment\nA negative work environment may not only result in unproductivity, but also mental health issues. Thus, employers should work towards establishing an open culture where employees can share their mental health struggles and challenges without being judged.\nFurther, employers can schedule team talks and one-to-one conversations with their employees on their mental health. This way, employees will feel safe in their work environment.\nOrganisational level\nReview employees’ mental state regularly\nAs part of risk assessment for workplace health, employers could conduct surveys or make use of a confidential online assessment tool to monitor the mental well-being of their employees.\nThe findings and data gathered from the surveys may help to chart the progress of the company in terms of improving the employees’ mental well-being.\nReview Human Resource policies\nEmployers should also ensure that their workplace practices do not discriminate against the mental well-being of employees. In particular, job applicants should not be asked to declare their mental health condition, unless it is a job-related requirement.\nAny appraisal system in the company should be fair and objective, and employees should be informed about the ways in which they can give feedback with full confidentiality.\nImplementation of flexible work arrangements\nOffering flexible work arrangements to employees may also assist greatly in helping them to meet both their work and personal demands. This will allow them to attain\nwork-life balance\n, which is crucial for promoting mental well-being. Maintaining work-life balance not only increases their overall mental well-being but also employee productivity and engagement.\nThe tripartite advisory recommends that employers consider implementing the following work arrangements:\nFlexi-place\n, where employees are allowed to work offsite via telecommuting and\nworking-from-home\n;\nFlexi-time\n, where work hours are adjusted to meet the needs of employees, such as by implementing staggered working hours or compressed workweek(s) to reduce the total number of days employees need to report to work; and/or\nFlexi-load\n, where the workload of employees is reduced, such as by allowing the employee to work part-time instead of full-time or offering job-sharing.\nEstablish a work-life harmony policy\nHaving in place a work-life harmony policy is crucial in promoting employees’ well-being in the long-run. This is because employers play an important role in helping employees obtain proper rest outside of work hours.\nSpecifically, the company should provide clarity on after-hours work communication, such as when employees are not expected to reply to work-related messages, or if they have to, how these employees will be given time-off for rest.\nEstablish return-to-work policies\nFor employees who are recovering from a mental health condition, employers should support them in returning to the workplace. This may be done through flexible work arrangements to help them transit back to work, while ensuring that they have time to receive treatments.\n—\nIf you find that work has taken a toll on your mental health, do not hesitate to reach out for help. There are numerous online and phone counselling services available, such as:\nNational CARE Hotline (1800-202-6868)\nSilver Ribbon (6358-3714)\nSingapore Association for Mental Health (1800-283-7019)\nYou may also find it helpful to refer to the\nlist of resources and service providers\nin the tripartite advisory.\nIf you are facing difficulties due to mistreatment at work that is affecting your mental well-being, you may also wish to consider\ngetting in touch with an employment disputes lawyer\n. He/she will be able to identify and advise you on possible actions to be taken against your employer, and/or legal remedies you may obtain as a result of the mistreatment.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Apart from the recommendations, the tripartite advisory also contains resources for employers to utilise.\nIs It Compulsory for Employers to Implement the Recommendations?\nThe recommendations are intended to outline certain practices and measures employers can adopt to support their employees’ mental well-being and are not meant to be legally binding on employers.\nWhile it is therefore not compulsory for employers to implement the recommendations, they are strongly encouraged to do so for the purpose of promoting employee mental well-being at the workplace.\nRecommendations in the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-Being at Workplaces\nThe tripartite advisory comprehensively sets out the recommendations and practices to be applied on three levels:\nThe individual employees\nTeam/department level\nOrganisational level\nIndividual employees\nAppointing mental wellness champions\nTo support individual employees, employers may consider appointing mental wellness champions to raise employees’ awareness on mental health by organising workshops or talks.\nThrough these programmes, employees will be exposed to mental well-being related issues, such as mental health conditions and coping methods.\nProvide access to counselling services\nEmployers may also consider providing employees access to counselling services, so that they are able to speak to a professional on their work and non-work related issues.\nThe tripartite advisory contains a list of service providers employers may tap on to provide such access to their employees, such as the Singapore Anglican Community Services Integrated Employment Services, Singapore Counselling Centre and Mind What Matters.\nExtend the scope of employee benefits\nEmployers are also encouraged to extend the scope of existing flexible employee benefits to include mental health consultations and treatments, as well as mental well-being programmes.\nTeam/department level\nTrain key personnel to detect mental distress and direct employees to seek help\nKey personnel members of companies, such as managers, supervisors or union leaders, could be trained to detect signs of mental distress, and intervene accordingly to refer employees to seek professional help.\nEmployers may consider utilising the\nresources listed in the tripartite advisory\n(under “Annex A”) to equip these members with the relevant skills.\nFor instance, employers and key personnel members of the company may wish to participate in Health Promotion Board’s Wellbeing@Work workshop that covers topics such as recognising mental health issues, or engage mental health training services from the Singapore Anglican Community Services that equips employers and supervisors with knowledge and skills on caring for the mental well-being of their employees.\nStrengthen the social support system at the workplace\nHaving a strong social support system will go hand-in-hand with the safeguarding of mental well-being.\nAs a result, employers are encouraged to organise bonding activities, and/or put in place internal systems to form strong support networks within the team/ departments.\nPromote a psychologically safe and trusting work environment\nA negative work environment may not only result in unproductivity, but also mental health issues. Thus, employers should work towards establishing an open culture where employees can share their mental health struggles and challenges without being judged.\nFurther, employers can schedule team talks and one-to-one conversations with their employees on their mental health. This way, employees will feel safe in their work environment.\nOrganisational level\nReview employees’ mental state regularly\nAs part of risk assessment for workplace health, employers could conduct surveys or make use of a confidential online assessment tool to monitor the mental well-being of their employees.\nThe findings and data gathered from the surveys may help to chart the progress of the company in terms of improving the employees’ mental well-being.\nReview Human Resource policies\nEmployers should also ensure that their workplace practices do not discriminate against the mental well-being of employees. In particular, job applicants should not be asked to declare their mental health condition, unless it is a job-related requirement.\nAny appraisal system in the company should be fair and objective, and employees should be informed about the ways in which they can give feedback with full confidentiality.\nImplementation of flexible work arrangements\nOffering flexible work arrangements to employees may also assist greatly in helping them to meet both their work and personal demands. This will allow them to attain\nwork-life balance\n, which is crucial for promoting mental well-being. Maintaining work-life balance not only increases their overall mental well-being but also employee productivity and engagement.\nThe tripartite advisory recommends that employers consider implementing the following work arrangements:\nFlexi-place\n, where employees are allowed to work offsite via telecommuting and\nworking-from-home\n;\nFlexi-time\n, where work hours are adjusted to meet the needs of employees, such as by implementing staggered working hours or compressed workweek(s) to reduce the total number of days employees need to report to work; and/or\nFlexi-load\n, where the workload of employees is reduced, such as by allowing the employee to work part-time instead of full-time or offering job-sharing.\nEstablish a work-life harmony policy\nHaving in place a work-life harmony policy is crucial in promoting employees’ well-being in the long-run. This is because employers play an important role in helping employees obtain proper rest outside of work hours.\nSpecifically, the company should provide clarity on after-hours work communication, such as when employees are not expected to reply to work-related messages, or if they have to, how these employees will be given time-off for rest.\nEstablish return-to-work policies\nFor employees who are recovering from a mental health condition, employers should support them in returning to the workplace. This may be done through flexible work arrangements to help them transit back to work, while ensuring that they have time to receive treatments.\n—\nIf you find that work has taken a toll on your mental health, do not hesitate to reach out for help. There are numerous online and phone counselling services available, such as:\nNational CARE Hotline (1800-202-6868)\nSilver Ribbon (6358-3714)\nSingapore Association for Mental Health (1800-283-7019)\nYou may also find it helpful to refer to the\nlist of resources and service providers\nin the tripartite advisory.\nIf you are facing difficulties due to mistreatment at work that is affecting your mental well-being, you may also wish to consider\ngetting in touch with an employment disputes lawyer\n. He/she will be able to identify and advise you on possible actions to be taken against your employer, and/or legal remedies you may obtain as a result of the mistreatment.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

You might also have encountered issues when you yourself were claiming reimbursement for employee benefits like maternity leave from the government.\nThis article will cover:\nWhat is a reimbursement? How is it different from a disbursement?\nFor which employee expenses are employers required to and not required to reimburse?\nDo employers need to pay CPF contributions for reimbursements?\nCan an employer refuse to reimburse employees?\nCan employers claim reimbursement for employee benefits/compensation and from whom?\nWhat is a Reimbursement? How is it Different from a Disbursement?\nA reimbursement is a sum of money paid by a company to an employee who has incurred an expense as a principal – in other words, when the employee contracts with a supplier\nin their own name or capacity\non the company’s behalf.\nFor example, if employees A and B, in the course of procuring goods for ABC Company, had to travel to meet a supplier and therefore incurred expenses in the form of taxi fares, they may claim reimbursement from ABC Company. This is because A and B had paid for the transport fares in their own name when they personally rode in the taxis to contract with a supplier on behalf of the company.\nOn the other hand, a disbursement is a sum of money paid by a company to someone when he or she incurred an expense as an agent – in other words, when that person contracts with a supplier\nin the name of the company or another person\n.\nTake for example if Company A engages organiser B to plan an event for Company A, and Company A orders door gifts from Company C under Company A’s name. When the gifts arrive at the event, Company A authorises organiser B to pay for the gifts.\nOrganiser B may claim a disbursement from Company A for the payments made for the gifts afterwards because Organiser B had made these payments under Company A’s name.\nFor which employee expenses are employers required to and not required to reimburse?\nEmployers may choose to reimburse employers for a range of expenses, with the most common being transport and medical expenses. However, employers are legally required to reimburse medical expenses under certain circumstances.\nTransport expenses\nTransport expenses include parking fees, taxi fares and fixed monthly transport allowances. Whether or not your company reimburses employees for their transport expenses is based on your company policy and the terms of your employee’s\nemployment contract\n.\nDo note that if you have given an employee an advance on travelling expenses, you are not allowed to recover the advance amount from your employee’s salary.\nMedical expenses\nUnder the Employment Act, if an employee has worked for you for at least 3 months, then his or her employer must pay for the employee’s medical consultation fee if:\nIt results in at least 1 day of paid sick leave; and\nIt arises from a medical certificate given to the employee by a medical practitioner who is either from an\napproved public medical institution\n(such as a polyclinic or public hospital) or appointed by your company.\nOn the other hand, employers are not required to:\nPay for the cost of medicine\nGrant paid sick leave or reimburse medical fees if your employee falls sick during public holidays, while on annual leave, or on their rest days or non-working days\nGrant paid sick leave or reimburse medical fees if your employee visits a doctor to undergo a cosmetic procedure. Whether or not a procedure is for cosmetic reasons will be based on the assessment of the doctor performing the examination\nNonetheless, employers may provide reimbursements beyond what the Employment Act provides for. For example, if your company policy states that employees may be reimbursed for certain cosmetic medical procedures, your employee should be able to claim reimbursement if they undergo such procedures.\nDo Employers Need to Pay CPF Contributions for Reimbursements?\nIf an employee is claiming reimbursement for an expense incurred by him and the expense is supported by official receipts or claim forms, then employers do not need to pay CPF contributions for such reimbursements.\nFor example, if your employee submits a receipt to claim a meal expense incurred while working overtime and your company policy is to reimburse your employees for such expenses, you do not need to pay CPF contributions for this reimbursement.\nOn the other hand, employers need to pay CPF contributions for allowances that are part of an employee’s wage. For example, if your employee is paid a fixed monthly transport allowance as part of his wage, no matter how much he or she spends on transport fares every month, you will need to pay CPF contributions for this monthly transport allowance.\nRead our other article to learn more on\nthe kinds of payments that attract CPF contributions\n.\nCan an Employer Refuse to Reimburse Employees?\nIf you do not reimburse employees for their medical consultation fees even though they are entitled to this under the Employment Act, you might be found guilty of a criminal offence and face a fine up to $5,000. Repeat offenders face a fine up to $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term up to 12 months, or to both.\nIf you fail to reimburse other expenses as required under your employee’s employment contract, your employees may be able to file a contractual salary-related claim against you in the\nEmployment Claims Tribunals (ECT)\n.\nDuring proceedings, the ECT will consider:\nThe nature of the claim,\nThe monetary value of the claim,\nWhether the claim is made out based on the supporting documents, and\nThe efforts made by you and the employee to settle the claim.\nAt the end of proceedings, the ECT will decide whether to require you to pay money to the employee, or dismiss the whole or any part of the claim.\nCan Employers Claim Reimbursement for Employee Benefits/Compensation and from Whom?\nAs an employer, you must continue paying your employees’ salary while they are on family leave (i.e. maternity, childcare and paternity leave). However, you can claim reimbursements for employee benefits for family leave from the government.\nEmployers are also required to compensate their employees for light duties arising from work injury, or work accidents. However, they can claim a reimbursement for this from their insurer for those insured under an insurance policy approved under the Work Injury Compensation Act.\nMaternity leave\nIf your employee meets the\neligibility criteria\nfor Government-Paid Maternity Leave (GPML), the government will reimburse you for at least 8 weeks of your employee’s 16 weeks of paid maternity leave for your employee’s first and second births, and the entire 16 weeks of paid maternity leave for her third or subsequent births.\nThe GPML reimbursement amount is capped at $10,000 per 4 weeks.\nPaternity leave\nIf your employee meets the\neligibility criteria\nfor Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL), you will be able to be fully reimbursed for your employee’s 4 weeks of paid paternity leave.\nThe GPPL reimbursement amount is capped at $2,500 per week.\nChildcare leave\nIf your employee meets the\neligibility criteria\nfor Government-Paid Childcare Leave (GPCL), you will be reimbursed for the 4th to 6th day of your employee’s 6 days of paid childcare leave per year.\nThe GPCL reimbursement amount is capped at $500 per day.\nProcedure for claiming family leave\nBefore you can successfully claim reimbursement for family leave, your employee must give you his or her declaration form at least 1 week before the start of the family leave.\nUnless your company has its own declaration forms:\nThe declaration form for maternity leave is\nForm GPMD1\nThe declaration form for paternity leave is\nForm GPFD1\nThe declaration form for childcare leave is\nForm GPCD1\nOnce your employee returns from family leave, you will have to\nsubmit your claim for reimbursement at the GPL Portal\nwithin 3 months of your employee’s last day of family leave.\nLight-duty compensation\nEmployers must compensate their employees who have been put on light duties after getting injured in a\nwork-related accident\n.\nAn employer covered under an insurance policy approved under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA) will be able to claim reimbursement for light-duty compensation from their insurer.\nTo claim such reimbursement after your employee has been injured or received a diagnosis of a work-related disease, you will need to\nsubmit a Notice of Accident\nto the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). The Notice will require you to provide the details of the incident, the details of the injured employee, and supporting documents like medical documents.\nYou will then have to pay for the employee’s medical leave wages and medical expenses, and your employee has to submit a claims processing form to MOM to claim compensation under WICA. MOM will then issue a Notice of Assessment to inform you, the employee, and your insurer of the compensation amount.\nAfter paying this amount, you will have to submit a claim on your insurer’s website to be reimbursed. You will likely need to submit documents such as your employee’s details, his/her medical documents, the Notice of Accident, and the Notice of Assessment.\nNote that the procedure for claiming reimbursement for light-duty compensation might differ based on your company’s insurer. It is best that you check with your insurer on the procedure to follow, and the necessary documents involved, before submitting a claim for reimbursement to them.\n—\nAs an employer, you have to reimburse your employees for medical expenses, and may choose to reimburse them for other expenses such as transport or meal expenses. You may also be able to claim family leave-related reimbursements from the government, and light-duty compensation from your insurer, in certain circumstances.\nIf you are facing a salary-related claim for allegedly failing to reimburse an employee, you are recommended to\nconsult an employment disputes lawyer\nfor legal advice on your options for resolving the dispute.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

However, the frequency and severity of the various senior management responsibilities under these measures vary with the job territory. Generally, though, there is a practical assumption that low-risk occupations like deskbound jobs will have fewer onerous obligations imposed on them than high-risk occupations like military roles. The following subsections are meant to briefly explain some of the key Measures:\nEnsuring timely risk assessments\nMeasure 11 states that risk assessments should be customised based on the specific organisation’s needs with subsequent control and risk-mitigating measures.\nAdditionally, one of the stated situations after which such measures need to be reviewed concerns external inclement weather or climate hazards – meaning that greater emphasis on safety protocols is necessary for construction sites or shipyards that could be exposed to water damage or heavy rain.\nThe resulting wear and tear of such dangerous equipment would entail high repair costs that will need to be footed by the relevant companies.\nFurther, ensuring adequate safety standards means that industrial sector companies cannot purchase dangerous equipment, such as cranes and oil rigs, from disreputable sources and must conduct further inspections to ensure quality control, as the Code of Practice places this burden on upper management.\nEnsuring adequate feedback and self-improvement mechanisms\nMoreover, the feedback mechanisms of the Code of Practice found in Measures 12-17 ensure that workers themselves are included in the designing and improvement of safety protocols – thereby taking advantage of their on-ground presence.\nSpecifically, the carrot-stick method that provides incentives for “good WSH behaviour” and meting out disciplinary measures in a timely fashion, encourages compliance with such standards (Measures 12 and 13). For example, handing out rewards (e.g. days off or bonuses) to employees for good work safety habits, and conversely punishing them through fines for possible breaches.\nMeasure 17, on the other hand, expands the scope of individuals from whom feedback on safety measures should be sought including independent contractors/vendors and union leaders.\nUnder Measure 11, where the industry is heavily reliant on multiple parties – for example, building construction which comprises various subcontractors and independent workers, upper management will need to be more “hands-on” and actively seek out feedback from them on suggestions to improve workplace safety. This could include discussing and setting specific work safety agenda at meetings as well as seeking advice from personnel at various levels in the workplace hierarchy on possible ways to improve work safety.\nHow Does the Code of Practice Tie in With the Current Law?\nThe Code of Practice supplements existing regulations governing workplace health and safety – primarily, the WSHA. The WSHA requires stakeholders – a broader category of individuals than under the Code of Practice, which includes employees and manufacturers to essentially work towards the same goals of workplace health and safety.\nHowever, while the Code of Practice largely seeks to provide clarity and increase accountability of upper management exclusively, it merely serves as a form of guidance and is not legally binding. The WSHA, on the other hand, is legally binding and includes statutory offences backed by punitive sentences that encompass a far broader variety of individuals in the workplace.\nThough, if individuals adhere to the standards under the Code of Practice, this can later be used as substantive evidence of attempts to adopt reasonable, practical channels aimed at preventing breaches from happening. For example, if a company regularly documents its work safety reports monthly instead of bi-annually, this could be viewed as compliance under Measure 3. On the other hand, if a company sanctions its employees for breaches of their internal work safety protocols in a tardy manner, this could be viewed as non-compliance. Conversely, claiming ignorance or a gross lack of non-adherence to the Code of Practice will probably enhance their liability when meting out sentences and raise legal penalties – this could include increased fines and other sanctions.\nThe 2022\nManta Equipment\ncase particularly discusses how this framework for the abovementioned increased sanctions will be orchestrated. The case considered the liability of the employer for failure to properly erect a construction tower crane. The victim employee was struck by the suspended jib of a tower crane being erected on a vessel at a shipyard that had not been rigged according to the manufacturer’s configuration and subsequently passed away from the injuries sustained. Under the new sentencing framework, the courts will now consider the level of harm and culpability of the accused and offender-specific aggravating or mitigating factors (where compliance/non-compliance with the Code will be effective).\nIt will be useful for you, as an employer, to be aware of the extent of your liability under the WSHA in order to properly mitigate risks. For a more detailed overview, you may wish to refer to our other article on the\nvarious workplace safety breaches and their corresponding penalties\n—\nWe do recommend that you\nconsult an\nemployment lawyer\nat first instance if you require professional advice on your liability under the Code of Practice.

{"chunk_id": "SLA_282f669d", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "How to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employer Obligations > How to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore", "text": "How to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nLast updated on December 12, 2024\nSince 1 April 2016, all Singapore employers have been required to issue itemised payslips to all employees covered under the Employment Act. If you are a business owner in Singapore who has just begun hiring staff, you may want to know more about preparing payslips for issuing to them.\nThis article will explain:\nWhat itemised payslips are\nWhen to issue itemised payslips\nWhat itemised payslips should contain\nHow to generate itemised payslips\nWhether you should keep a record of itemised payslips\nWhat is an Itemised Payslip?\nAn itemised payslip is a document that states what your employees’ pay consists of. Payslips need to include information such as your employee’s basic pay, overtime pay, bonuses,\nCentral Provident Fund (CPF) deductions\nand other salary-related matters. An itemised payslip can therefore be used to provide proof of salary amounts and payment.\nIssuing payslips (and abiding by the strict requirements when doing so, which will be covered in more detail later) may seem like more work for businesses and Human Resources departments. However, by breaking down their employees’ salary in a standardised payslip, employers are able to give employees a sense of security and assurance for being paid fairly. This may translate into more trust and confidence in their employers such that the employees would want to continue working with their employers.\nMoreover, since all the important monetary information relating to the employee’s salaries and benefits is stated clearly in the payslip, employers may also receive fewer salary complaints from employees, or be able to resolve such complaints quicker.\nFor example, an employee may file a salary complaint if he/she feels that there has been an unfair deduction in her salary. However, being able to produce a payslip that shows the proper breakdown of the salary deductions may help to resolve the dispute amicably.\nAre You Required to Give Your Employees Payslips in Singapore?\nIt is\ncompulsory\nfor you to issue itemised payslips to your employees in Singapore if they are\ncovered under the Employment Act\n. Employees are people working under a contract of service, and they include both local and foreign employees. However, seafarers, domestic workers, statutory board employees and civil servants are not covered under the Employment Act, and you are hence not required to issue itemised payslips to them.\nYou must issue the payslips together with the salary or payment given to your employee. If you are unable to issue the payslip and salary together, then you must give the payslip within 3 working days of issuing the salary.\nIf you are going to, or have\nterminated\nor dismissed your employee, then you must give your employee his or her payslip together with the outstanding salary.\nIf you fail to provide itemised payslips, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) can order you to do so within 1 month. For repeat offenders, MOM will issue caution letters and can further impose an administrative penalty of up to $400 fine for each repeated infringement.\nIt is also an offence under the Employment Act to:\nNot provide itemised payslips within the timeframe stated above, regardless of whether this had been intentional.\nFailure to provide an accurate or complete payslip, regardless of whether this had been intentional.\nHence, apart from having to pay the administrative penalty stated above, you may also be charged in court for an offence if you fail to provide accurate payslips in a timely manner. If found guilty, you may be liable to a fine of up to $5,000 and/or a jail term of up to 6 months for each offence. For every day that you fail to produce the itemised payslip or rectify an inaccurate one, you may be liable to a further fine of up to $500.\nWhat Should the Payslips Contain?\nThere is no prescribed form for payslips, and they can be in either hardcopy (including handwritten payslips) or softcopy format. However, softcopy payslips must be accessible and useable by the employee if he or she wishes to refer to it subsequently. In addition, you are legally required to include the following 12 details in the payslips:\nThe employer’s full name;\nYour employee’s full name;\nDate of payment (or dates, if the payslips consolidate multiple payments);\nBasic salary (for hourly, daily or piece-rated workers, indicate the basic rate of pay, e.g. $X per hour, and the total number of hours or days worked or pieces produced);\nStart and end date of salary period;\nAllowances paid for salary period, such as all fixed allowances, e.g. transport, and all ad-hoc allowances, e.g. one-off uniform allowance);\nAny other additional payment for each salary period, such as bonuses, rest day pay and public holiday pay;\nDeductions made for each salary period, such as all fixed deductions (e.g. employee’s CPF contribution), and all ad-hoc deductions (e.g. deductions for no-pay leave, absence from work);\nOvertime hours worked;\nOvertime pay;\nStart and end date of overtime payment period (if different from number 5 on start and end date of salary period); and\nNet salary paid in total.\nHow Can You Generate a Payslip?\nYou may wish to use the\npayslip template\nprovided by MOM and generate your payslips manually. However, a more convenient alternative would be to invest in software that can help to automate the process of generating and sending payslips.\nIf you are afraid that such software may be expensive, you may look into applying for the\nProductivity Solutions Grant (PSG)\nto defray their costs. Generally, to apply for the PSG, your business would need to be registered and operating in Singapore. The software intended to be purchased, or subscribed to by your business must also be used in Singapore. More information can be found on the PSG\nwebsite\n.\nDo You Have to Keep Records of All Payslips Issued?\nYou are required to keep records of itemised payslips for current employees for the latest 2 years. For former employees, you need to keep the last 2 years of records for 1 year after their last day of employment.\n—\nIt is compulsory to issue itemised payslips, and the payslips must be both complete and accurate (containing all 12 legally required details). Failure to do so can constitute an offence. You may also want to make use of PSG to cover the costs of any software you may decide to invest in for generating and sending payslips. Remember to keep records of your payslips for at least 2 years as well.\nAs an employer, apart from abiding by the requirement to provide payslips, you are also legally obliged to follow other\nemployment laws in Singapore\n. These laws include following the terms in the employment contract, such as paying your employees the correct amount on time, providing the agreed employee benefits and terminating your employees fairly and with the required notice.\nYou may wish to consult an employment lawyer if you need legal advice on complying with employment laws. In the event of a dispute, an\nemployment lawyer\ncan also advise you on the terms in the employment contract and on how to resolve legal claims against your business from your employees.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

If you are a business owner in Singapore who has just begun hiring staff, you may want to know more about preparing payslips for issuing to them.\nThis article will explain:\nWhat itemised payslips are\nWhen to issue itemised payslips\nWhat itemised payslips should contain\nHow to generate itemised payslips\nWhether you should keep a record of itemised payslips\nWhat is an Itemised Payslip?\nAn itemised payslip is a document that states what your employees’ pay consists of. Payslips need to include information such as your employee’s basic pay, overtime pay, bonuses,\nCentral Provident Fund (CPF) deductions\nand other salary-related matters. An itemised payslip can therefore be used to provide proof of salary amounts and payment.\nIssuing payslips (and abiding by the strict requirements when doing so, which will be covered in more detail later) may seem like more work for businesses and Human Resources departments. However, by breaking down their employees’ salary in a standardised payslip, employers are able to give employees a sense of security and assurance for being paid fairly. This may translate into more trust and confidence in their employers such that the employees would want to continue working with their employers.\nMoreover, since all the important monetary information relating to the employee’s salaries and benefits is stated clearly in the payslip, employers may also receive fewer salary complaints from employees, or be able to resolve such complaints quicker.\nFor example, an employee may file a salary complaint if he/she feels that there has been an unfair deduction in her salary. However, being able to produce a payslip that shows the proper breakdown of the salary deductions may help to resolve the dispute amicably.\nAre You Required to Give Your Employees Payslips in Singapore?\nIt is\ncompulsory\nfor you to issue itemised payslips to your employees in Singapore if they are\ncovered under the Employment Act\n. Employees are people working under a contract of service, and they include both local and foreign employees. However, seafarers, domestic workers, statutory board employees and civil servants are not covered under the Employment Act, and you are hence not required to issue itemised payslips to them.\nYou must issue the payslips together with the salary or payment given to your employee. If you are unable to issue the payslip and salary together, then you must give the payslip within 3 working days of issuing the salary.\nIf you are going to, or have\nterminated\nor dismissed your employee, then you must give your employee his or her payslip together with the outstanding salary.\nIf you fail to provide itemised payslips, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) can order you to do so within 1 month. For repeat offenders, MOM will issue caution letters and can further impose an administrative penalty of up to $400 fine for each repeated infringement.\nIt is also an offence under the Employment Act to:\nNot provide itemised payslips within the timeframe stated above, regardless of whether this had been intentional.\nFailure to provide an accurate or complete payslip, regardless of whether this had been intentional.\nHence, apart from having to pay the administrative penalty stated above, you may also be charged in court for an offence if you fail to provide accurate payslips in a timely manner. If found guilty, you may be liable to a fine of up to $5,000 and/or a jail term of up to 6 months for each offence. For every day that you fail to produce the itemised payslip or rectify an inaccurate one, you may be liable to a further fine of up to $500.\nWhat Should the Payslips Contain?\nThere is no prescribed form for payslips, and they can be in either hardcopy (including handwritten payslips) or softcopy format. However, softcopy payslips must be accessible and useable by the employee if he or she wishes to refer to it subsequently. In addition, you are legally required to include the following 12 details in the payslips:\nThe employer’s full name;\nYour employee’s full name;\nDate of payment (or dates, if the payslips consolidate multiple payments);\nBasic salary (for hourly, daily or piece-rated workers, indicate the basic rate of pay, e.g. $X per hour, and the total number of hours or days worked or pieces produced);\nStart and end date of salary period;\nAllowances paid for salary period, such as all fixed allowances, e.g. transport, and all ad-hoc allowances, e.g. one-off uniform allowance);\nAny other additional payment for each salary period, such as bonuses, rest day pay and public holiday pay;\nDeductions made for each salary period, such as all fixed deductions (e.g. employee’s CPF contribution), and all ad-hoc deductions (e.g. deductions for no-pay leave, absence from work);\nOvertime hours worked;\nOvertime pay;\nStart and end date of overtime payment period (if different from number 5 on start and end date of salary period); and\nNet salary paid in total.\nHow Can You Generate a Payslip?\nYou may wish to use the\npayslip template\nprovided by MOM and generate your payslips manually.

This includes the healthcare sector, but subject to certain guidelines (discussed below).\nHowever, Muslim women are not allowed to wear the\ntudung\nwhile working in uniformed sectors like the police and armed forces. This is because their uniform signals to the community that their services are rendered equally and regardless of race or religion.\nAs per the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore or\nMajlis Ugama Islam Singapura\n(MUIS), Muslim women are required to wear the\ntudung\nbut can be excused from this requirement when working in uniformed groups.

MUIS regards these as legitimate considerations that allow more flexibility in donning (or not donning) the\ntudung at work.\nGuidelines on Wearing the\nTudung\nin the Healthcare Sector\nThere are certain guidelines that those wearing the\ntudung\nin the healthcare sector should adhere to. First, nurses will have to adhere to the “bare below the elbows” (BBE) policy. This entails wearing short-sleeved attire that keeps their forearms bare during patient care, to reduce the risk of infection and ensure the safety of the healthcare staff and the patient.\nSecond, as per the National Healthcare Group’s Chief Human Resource Officer, the\ntudung\nshould not compromise the proper usage of an N95 surgical mask. The\ntudung\nmay compromise the proper usage of the mask if it is modified with extenders, as this may not allow a proper seal for the mask to function well.\nThird, as per the National University Health System (NUHS), the nurses are not allowed to have any embellishments on their headscarves. They are also encouraged to wear\ntudungs\nthat are made of breathable or sweat-wicking material if working in non-air-conditioned settings.\nFourth, the\ntudung\nwill not be allowed in high-risk settings that require more stringent levels of cleanliness like operating theatres, where only single-use disposable caps are allowed.\nCan an Employer Prohibit Me From Wearing the\nTudung\n?\nIn situations where you are allowed to wear the\ntudung\nat work\n,\nyour employer cannot prohibit you from doing so. All employers are expected to comply with the principles of fair employment practices as promoted by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) government agency.\nOn the other hand, an employer may impose restrictions on wearing the\ntudung\nat the workplace, if for example, a standard uniform is required due to the nature of work. TAFEP guidelines state that if such a restriction is implemented, the person in question should be informed about the restrictions at the application stage of employment. This allows the potential employee to be aware of the rules and restrictions of the place of employment when deciding whether to proceed with their job application.\n—\nMost workplaces in Singapore should allow the\ntudung\nto be worn. However, if you know that there are no restrictions on wearing\ntudung\nat your workplace, yet are still being asked to remove your\ntudung\n, you can\nreport the incident to TAFEP\n.

In line with this, under the\nChild Development Co-Savings Act\n(CDCA), new fathers may be entitled to up to:\n2 weeks’ of government-paid paternity leave\nif their children are born (or adopted)\non or after 1 January 2017\n; or\n4 weeks’ of government-paid paternity leave\nif their children are born (or adopted)\non or after 1 January 2024\n.\nEligibility for Paternity Leave: Fathers of\nBiological\nChildren\nBasic requirements\nFor a father to be entitled to paternity leave in respect of a biological child, his child must either:\nBe a Singapore citizen from birth (This includes stillborn births* for children born on or after 1 January 2017)\n. A child will automatically be a Singapore citizen from birth if the child is\nborn in Singapore and at least one parent is also a Singapore citizen\n; or\nBecome a Singapore citizen within 12 months of birth\n.\n*Paternity leave applicable in the case of children born\non or after 1 January 2024 excludes a stillborn child\n.\nThe child’s parents must also have been\nmarried\n:\nAt the time of the child’s birth\n;\nFor some time between the child’s conception and birth\n. This can apply even if the parents are now no longer married; or\nWithin 12 months of the child’s birth\n. For this scenario, the parents should marry within 1 year of the birth. This is because paid paternity leave has to be taken within 1 year of the child’s birth.\nMinimum duration of work\nApart from these requirements, the father must have been working for his employer (if he is an employee) or for himself (if he is self-employed)\nfor a continuous period of 3 months\n.\nFor the purposes of paid paternity leave, the CDCA provides that\nan employee is a person who “works under a contract of service with an employer in Singapore”\n, including Government employees.\nIf a person has agreed to work under a contract of service, this generally means that he has\nagreed to carry out tasks his employer requests him to do\nover the course of the employer-employee relationship. Generally, if an employer has control over what an employee does, when he does it and how he does it, then there is likely to be a contract of service.\nIf, however, a person has contracted to provide a fixed list of services on an\nad hoc\nbasis (i.e. a\ncontract\nfor\nservice\n), then that person will not be regarded as an employee. He is likely to be self-employed instead.\nThe CDCA defines a “self-employed man” as being a person who:\n“engages in or carries on any trade, business, profession or vocation other than employment under a contract of service”.\nSelf-employment would include:\nTaking up odd-jobs;\nWorking freelance under a\nfreelance agreement\n; and\nBeing an\nowner of a business\n.\nNote, however, that the CDCA requires\nself-employed fathers to be Singapore residents\nbefore they can qualify for paid paternity leave.\nEligibility for Paternity Leave: Fathers of\nAdopted Children\nFathers of\nadopted children\nare entitled to paid paternity leave if the child has been\nadopted within 1 year of the date of the “Formal Intent to Adopt”\n.\nThe date of the “Formal Intent to Adopt” refers to:\nFor children who are already Singapore citizens:\nthe date when an application to adopt the child is first made to the court; or\nFor children who are not yet Singapore citizens:\nthe date when the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA) approves the child’s Dependant’s Pass.\nThe adopted child must also:\nBe a Singapore citizen from birth.\nAs mentioned above, a child will automatically be a Singapore citizen from birth if the child is\nborn in Singapore and at least one parent is also a Singapore citizen\n; or\nBecomes a Singapore citizen within 6 months of the date of adoption.\nHowever, the adoptive father or mother must also be a Singapore citizen on the date that the child’s Dependant’s Pass is issued.\nFinally, unless the date of the “Formal Intent to Adopt” is on or after 1 January 2017, the adoptive parent(s) also have to be\nmarried before or on the date of the “Formal Intent to Adopt”\n.\nSummary of Paternity Leave Eligibility Requirements\nHere is a summary of the eligibility requirements for paternity leave:\nMust the child be a Singapore citizen?\nWhen must the parents be married?\nHow long must the father have been working for?\n(whether as an employee or self-employed man)\nOther requirements\nBiological children\n(Whether father is employed or self-employed)\nYes\nEither from birth (including stillborn births for children born on or after 1 January 2017 but not 1 January 2024) or within 12 months of birth\nAt the time of the child’s birth;\nSome time between the child’s conception and birth; or\nWithin 12 months of the child’s birth\n3 months\nSelf-employed fathers must be Singapore residents\nAdopted children\nYes\nEither from birth or within 6 months of the date of adoption\nParents only need to be married where the date of the “Formal Intent to Adopt” is before 1 January 2017\nChild to be adopted within 1 year of the date of “Formal Intent to Adopt”\nLength of Paid Paternity Leave Entitlement\nWorking fathers who meet all the above requirements will be entitled to\n2 weeks\nof paid paternity leave if their child is born on or after 1 January 2017.\nIf their child is born on or after 1 January 2024, working fathers are entitled to 2 weeks of paid paternity leave and may take an\nadditional 2 weeks\nof paid paternity leave, if their employers allow them to do so.\nThis entitlement is calculated on a per-day basis. Therefore, if you normally work 5 days a week, then the Government will compensate either your employer or yourself (for employed fathers and self-employed fathers respectively) for 10 days’ worth of your salary.\nThe paternity leave entitlement is capped at $2,500 per week, including Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions, and a maximum of 6 days per week.\nHowever,\nfrom 1 April 2025, the additional 2 weeks of voluntary GPPL will be mandatory\n. This means that working fathers with Singapore citizen children born on or after 1 April 2025 will be entitled to\n4 weeks\nof paid paternity leave.\nEmployed fathers\nIt is best for employed fathers to take paternity leave only after discussing with their employers how the leave will be taken, for mutual convenience and to preserve a good working relationship.\nIf the employer allows the employed father to\ntake paternity leave flexibly\n, then he may take the paid paternity leave at any time within 12 months of his child’s birth (or adoption). This can be done either as one continuous 2-week block, or split up into separate working days and taken in any mutually-agreed combination.\nAlternatively, parties may opt for the\ndefault arrangement\n. The default arrangement is for the employed father to take 2 continuous weeks of paid paternity leave within 16 weeks of the child’s birth (or adoption).\nSelf-employed fathers\nSelf-employed fathers can use their paid paternity leave at any time\nwithin 12 months of their children’s birth (or adoption)\n, depending on their work commitments.\nSelf-employed fathers who stop working to care for their child, within 12 months of the child’s birth, are also eligible to claim from the government for loss of income.\nWhat if an Employed Father Changes Jobs Before Using Up His Paid Paternity Leave Entitlement?\nIf an employed father leaves his job (whether by choice or otherwise) after his child is born before fully using his paid paternity leave entitlement, he cannot transfer his remaining paid paternity leave entitlement to any new employer.\nHowever, if an employed father has been dismissed by his employer because he wanted to claim paid paternity leave, he may be able to bring a claim for\nunfair dismissal\nand seek compensation from his former employer.\nPenalties for Errant Employers\nEmployers who deny, without reasonable cause, employed fathers of their paid paternity leave entitlement may be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed up to 6 months. These penalties increase to fines of up to $10,000 and jail terms of up to 12 months for repeat offenders.\nEmployers should also be particularly careful not to breach their paid paternity leave obligations due to the negative publicity which may result.\nAdditional Leave Arrangements\nShared parental leave\nIn addition to paid paternity leave, an employed father may, with his wife’s agreement, use up to\n4 weeks\nof her\npaid maternity leave\n(and reduce her paid maternity leave entitlement by the same amount of leave). This is known as\nshared parental leave\n.\n4-week shared parental leave is only available to parents of\nchildren born from 1 July 2017 onwards\n. Fathers of children born between 1 May 2013 and 1 July 2017 are entitled to share only 1 week of their wives’ paid maternity leave.\nFor an employed father to be eligible for shared parental leave:\nThe child’s mother must be entitled to\npaid maternity leave\n;\nThe child must be a Singapore citizen or, would have been a Singapore citizen in the case of a stillborn child; and\nThe employed father qualifies for paid paternity leave.\nAn employed father may, by mutual agreement with his employer, take any combination of leave which adds up to 4 weeks within 12 months of his child’s birth (or adoption).\nAlternatively, employed fathers may choose to take shared parental leave in the default arrangement of a continuous period of 4 weeks within 12 months of their children’s birth (or adoption).\nShared parental leave taken by employed fathers is capped at $2,500 per week, including CPF contributions, and for a maximum of 6 days per week.\nNew shared parental leave scheme\nNote that from 1 April 2025, a new scheme comprising 10 weeks of paid parental leave, shared between both parents will be implemented in two phases:\nFrom 1 April 2025: 6 weeks of shared parental leave\nFrom 1 April 2026: 10 weeks of shared parental leave\nEach parent is allocated half of the shared parental leave by default, though parents can reallocate their share to each other to suit caregiving needs.\nOther leave arrangements\nApart from shared parental leave, employed parents should find out if their employers have additional leave allowances or benefits for new parents as part of an internal company policy.\nApplying for Paid Paternity Leave\nFathers can apply for paid paternity leave (and/or shared paternity leave) through the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s\nGovernment-Paid Leave portal\n.\nEmployed fathers are however encouraged to approach and inform their companies’ human resource departments of their intention to apply for paid paternity leave before doing so.\n—\nIf you need legal advice on determining and/or enforcing your paternity leave rights, you can\nget in touch with one of our trusted employment lawyers here\n.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

In Singapore, we have laws that provide for maternity leave for expecting mothers.\nMaternity leave is essential in helping working mothers spend time with their newborns while recovering from pregnancy and childbirth, and in ensuring that mothers can remain employed.\nThis article will aim to explain Singapore’s maternity leave laws with regard to maternity leave entitlement, maternity pay as well as employer-employee disputes and obligations during maternity leave.\nWho is Entitled to Paid Maternity Leave?\nUnder the Employment Act (EA)\nAll expecting mothers (both locals and foreigners) who are\ncovered under the EA\nare entitled to paid maternity leave.\nExamples of expecting mothers who will not qualify for maternity leave under the EA include:\nManagers or executives who earn more than $4,500 basic salary per month;\nSeafarers;\nDomestic workers; or\nCivil servants or statutory board employees.\nUnder the Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA)\nMothers who may not qualify under the EA may be covered under the CDCA, which has fewer conditions to be satisfied in order to be eligible for paid maternity leave.\nThe CDCA grants maternity leave if:\nThe mother’s:\nBirth of the child occurs;\nEstimated delivery date is on or after 1 January 2017; or\nEstimated delivery date is after 1 November 2021 in the case of a stillborn child;\nThe mother’s child is a Singapore citizen or, would have been a Singapore citizen in the case of a stillborn child; and\nThe mother has been employed or self-employed for at least 3 months immediately before the child’s birth.\nThe CDCA defines a “self-employed woman” as being a person who:\n“engages in or carries on any trade, business, profession or vocation other than employment under a contract of service”.\nUnder the Government-Paid Maternity Leave (GPML) scheme\nThe Government-Paid Maternity Leave (GPML) scheme is provided in accordance with the CDCA. The same conditions for maternity leave under the CDCA apply, except that the GPML also applies to unwed mothers.\nUnder the Government-Paid Maternity Benefit (GPMB) scheme\nThe Government-Paid Maternity Benefit (GPMB) scheme applies to expecting mothers who do not qualify for GPML. Such expecting mothers could include those who have not worked for an employer for at least 3 months prior to the child’s birth, or those in short-term employment.\nThe GPMB scheme will cover expecting mothers who have been employed for at least 3 months within the 12 months preceding their child’s birth.\nMaternity Leave\nHow many weeks of maternity leave am I entitled to?\nMaternity leave in Singapore is inclusive of non-working days, rest days and public holidays.\nUnder the EA\nAn expecting mother who qualifies for maternity leave under the EA is entitled to\n12 weeks\nof maternity leave.\nUnder the CDCA and GPML\nA mother who is covered by the CDCA and GPML is entitled to\n16 weeks\nof maternity leave.\nWhen can I start maternity leave?\nBy default, a mother may start the maternity leave 4 weeks before the scheduled date of delivery and continue the 8 weeks (for a 12-week maternity leave) or 12 weeks (for a 16-week maternity leave) from the scheduled date of delivery.\nAlternatively, if the employer agrees, a mother can start the first consecutive 8 weeks of maternity leave any time in the 4 weeks before delivery.\nThe last 4 or 8 weeks of maternity leave (for 12-week and 16-week leave entitlements respectively) may be flexibly taken any time within a year of the child’s birth.\nThis flexible leave of 4 or 8 weeks can be calculated as follows:\nFor 12 weeks of maternity leave\n, 4 weeks x the number of working days per week. This will be capped at 24 working days.\nFor 16 weeks of maternity leav\ne, 8 weeks x the number of working days per week, capped at 48 working days.\nCan my husband use my maternity leave?\nA mother may choose to share a maximum of 4 weeks of her maternity leave with her working husband and increase her husband’s 2-week\npaternity leave\naccordingly.\nNote that from 1 April 2025, a new scheme comprising 10 weeks of paid parental leave, shared between both parents will be implemented in two phases:\nFrom 1 April 2025: 6 weeks of shared parental leave\nFrom 1 April 2026: 10 weeks of shared parental leave\nEach parent is allocated half of the shared parental leave by default, though parents can reallocate their share to each other to suit caregiving needs.\nMaternity Pay\nHow many weeks of maternity leave will I be paid for?\nUnder the EA\nUnder the EA, if a mother worked for her employer for at least 3 months before the delivery and has less than 2 children (excluding twins/triplets) at the time of delivery, her employer will pay her\n8 weeks of her usual monthly salary\n.\nHowever, if she does not give her employer at least a week of notice before going on maternity leave (and does not have a good reason for not giving such notice), she is only entitled to receive half the payment.\nThe last 4 weeks of maternity leave would be unpaid unless provided for in her\nemployment contract\n.\nWhat if my employer asks me to work during my maternity leave?\nUnder the EA, an employer is prohibited from asking a mother to work in the first 4 weeks of her child’s birth (including a stillborn child).\nIf she works on any day during the remaining 8 weeks of her maternity leave, she is entitled to that day’s salary, or to claim another day of leave, in addition to her maternity pay.\nUnder the CDCA and GMPL\nIf a mother is covered by the CDCA or GPML, she is entitled to be paid her monthly salary by her employer for all\n16 weeks\nof her maternity leave.\nThe mother’s employer may claim reimbursement from the government for the last 8 weeks of her first and second births, and for the entire 16 weeks of her third or subsequent births.\nUnder the Government-Paid Maternity Benefit (GPMB) scheme\nUnder the GPMB scheme, for the first and second births, a mother will be paid for 8 weeks of her maternity leave. While, for the third and subsequent births, a mother will be paid for all 16 weeks of her maternity leave.\nSpecial Situations of Maternity Leave Entitlement\nThe maternity leave entitlements may differ in special situations such as:\nThe\ndelivering of twins or triplets\nwill be treated as a single delivery and there are no double/triple maternity benefits;\nWhere if the child was\nborn prematurely\n, the mother is entitled to 16 weeks of maternity leave from the child’s date of birth or from a date agreed with her employer;\nIf the child is\nstillborn\n, the mother is eligible for the full maternity leave;\nWhere a mother\nsuffers a miscarriage\nor\nundergoes an\nabortion\n, she is not eligible for maternity leave and may instead take sick paid leave; and\nIf a mother\nfalls sick\nduring her maternity leave, she cannot take paid sick leave.\nAdoption leave\nUnder the CDCA, a female employee is entitled to 12 weeks of adoption leave starting from the following eligible dates:\nDate of filing of the court application, if the adopted child is a Singapore citizen; or\nDate of when receiving the in-principle approval for a dependant’s pass, if the adopted child is a foreigner.\nThe mother can only start taking adoption leave after her eligibility date, but must finish it before the child’s first birthday.\nThe eligibility criteria for adoption leave for female employees or self-employed women include the following conditions:\nThe female employee has worked for her employer, or is self-employed, for at least 3 months before the eligible date;\nOn the eligible date, the child is below 12 months old;\nWhere the child is a foreigner and a dependant’s pass has been issued for the child:\nThe female employee or self-employed woman must be a Singapore citizen; or\nEither of the adoptive parents must be a Singapore citizen; and\nThe female employee or self-employed woman is not the biological mother of the child.\nThe adoption order must be passed within 1 year from the eligible date.\nThe mother’s employer may claim reimbursement from the government:\nFor the last 8 weeks of the mother’s first and second adoption application or issuance of dependant’s pass for the child; or\nFor the entire 12 weeks of the mother’s third and fourth adoption application or issuance of dependant’s pass for the child.\nMaternity Leave Disputes\nCan my employer dismiss me because I’m on maternity leave?\nIt is an offence for an employer to dismiss an employee who is on maternity leave.\nIf an employer dismisses an expecting mother within 6 months from the date of estimated delivery (as certified by a medical practitioner) or the date of delivery itself, without sufficient cause, the employer is liable to pay her the maternity benefits that she would have been entitled to.\nThe same applies if an employer has no choice but to\nretrench\nan expecting mother within 3 months from the date of estimated delivery or the date of her confinement – the employer will still have to pay her the maternity benefits.\nWhat should I do if I’m unfairly dismissed (or face some other dispute) during my maternity leave?\nIf there is a dispute over her maternity leave, the mother is encouraged to engage in discussions with her employer to try and resolve these disputes internally.\nIf these discussions fail, a mother who is covered by the EA and the CDCA has the following avenues:\nFile a mediation claim with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management for\nunfair dismissal\n.\nSeek the union’s help if she is a member of a trade union.\nSeek legal help\n.\nEmployer-Employee Obligations during Maternity Leave\nAm I allowed to work for another employer during my maternity leave?\nA mother is not allowed to work for another employer during her maternity leave.

With this in mind, do they have employment rights?\nAs an employer, it is important to know the answer to this question so that you may adequately fulfil your employment obligations in Singapore.\nContents Menu\nEmployment Rights of Interns in Singapore\nEmployment Rights of Trainees in Singapore\nEmployment Rights of Interns in Singapore\nUnder the Employment Act, an employee is defined as a “person who has entered into or works under a contract of service (i.e. an\nemployment contract\n) with an employer”.  This contract could be written, verbal, express or implied.\nHence, as long as you employ an intern under a contract of service, the intern will be considered an employee and be\ncovered under the Employment Act\n.\nThis article will assume that this is the scenario for interns.\nHowever, the Ministry of Manpower has clarified that\nstudents undergoing internships as part of their school requirements are not covered under the Employment Act\n. As a result, the employment rights of interns stated in this article do not apply to them.\nAre interns required to be paid?\nThere is no minimum allowance requirement stipulated for interns under the Employment Act. Therefore, internship programmes can be unpaid. However, you are encouraged to provide monthly stipends to defray the food and travelling expenses incurred by your interns during the employment period.\nIn addition, if you are applying for government grants to offset the costs of hiring an intern, be aware that minimum allowance requirements may apply.\nFor instance, employers keen on receiving up to 50% government support for internship allowances under the\nGlobal Ready Talent Programme (Internships)\nmust offer interns a minimum monthly allowance (before funding) of $800 to ITE and polytechnic students and $1,000 to university students.\nHow often must interns be paid?\nEmployers may determine how often to pay their interns their allowances. However, you need to make payment at least once per month.\nThe allowance must be made before the expiry of the 7th day after the last day of the allowance period. For overtime payment, it must be paid within 14 days after the last day of the allowance period during which the overtime work was performed.\nYou must also pay allowance on a pro-rated basis if the intern has not completed a whole month of service because:\nHe commenced employment after the first day of the month;\nYour intern’s contract was terminated before the end of the month;\nYour intern took unpaid leave for one day or more; or\nYour intern took leave to perform his national service obligations.\nPro-rated allowance is calculated based on the following formula:\n(Monthly gross rate of pay x Number of days the employee actually worked in that month)/(Number of days which the employee is required to work in that month)\nFor instance, if your intern’s monthly pay is $800 and they are required to work 20 days a month but your intern works for only 10 days, the pro-rated allowance you would owe to your intern would be $400. For any day on which the intern worked for 5 hours or fewer, it shall be regarded as a half-day for this calculation.\nIf the intern terminates his contract with prior notice to the employer, the total allowance due to him must be paid to him on the day on which the contract is terminated. If the intern had not given prior notice to the employer, the employer may make the salary payment before the expiry of the 7th day after the day on which he terminated his contract.\nThe required notice period is usually stated in the terms of the employment contract. If there is no such provision, the notice period for termination should be given as follows:\nEmployment Period\nNotice Period\nShorter than 26 weeks\n1 day’s notice\n26 weeks or more but shorter than 2 years\n1 week’s notice\nAre interns entitled to CPF contributions?\nInterns are generally entitled to\nCPF contributions\n. This is unless they fall within exceptions such as:\nStudents who are enrolled in an institution or programme subsidised by the Ministry of Education and employed for training approved by their educational institution. For example:\nPolytechnic, ITE and university students undertaking approved internships (whether during the school term or school holiday period)\nOverseas university students required to take up internships of up to 6 months in Singapore\nAre interns entitled to take leave?\nPro-rated annual leave\nAs employees, your interns may be entitled to paid annual leave on a pro-rated basis, if they have worked for at least 3 months. Since internships are short-term and may not extend to 12 months, the annual leave of interns is calculated in proportion to the number of completed months of service in that year.\nIn this calculation, any fraction of a day that is less than one-half of a day is disregarded while any fraction of a day which is more than one-half will be regarded as one day.\nFor instance, unless the employment contract provides for a more generous annual leave entitlement, an employee who serves an employer for 1 year will be entitled to 7 days of annual leave. On this basis, an intern on a 6-month contract with you will be entitled to (6/12) x 7 = 4 days of paid annual leave (rounded up from 3.5 days).\nIf the intern absents himself without the employer’s permission or without reasonable excuse for more than 20% of the working days, he forfeits his entitlement to annual leave.\nSick leave\nYour interns are also entitled to sick leave as certified by a medical practitioner as follows:\nEmployment Period\nAmount of sick leave if no hospitalisation is necessary\nAmount of sick leave if hospitalisation is necessary\nAt least 3 months but shorter than 4 months\n5 days\nEither 15 days or 5 days plus the number of days the intern is hospitalised for, whichever is fewer\nAt least 4 months but shorter than 5 months\n8 days\nEither 30 days or 8 days plus the number of days the intern is hospitalised for, whichever is fewer\nAt least 5 months but shorter than 6 months\n11 days\nEither 45 days or 11 days plus the number of days the intern is hospitalised for, whichever is fewer\n6 months or more\n14 days\nEither 60 days or 14 days plus the number of days the intern is hospitalised for, whichever is fewer\nReceiving of Key Employment Terms (KET)\nYou are obligated to issue KETs in writing to your intern who will be employed for 14 days or more under an employment contract on or after 1 April 2016. The KETs can be handwritten or in soft or hard copy, and must be issued within 14 days after the start of employment.\nThe KETs must include the following items unless they are not applicable:\nFull name of employer and employee;\nEmployee’s job title, main duties and responsibilities;\nStart date of employment;\nDuration of employment;\nWorking arrangements, including the daily working hours, number of working hours per week and rest days;\nSalary period and basic salary (specifying basic rate of pay if required);\nFixed allowances and deductions;\nOvertime payment period and rate of pay;\nOther salary-related components, including bonuses and incentives;\nType of leave, such as annual leave, outpatient sick leave, hospitalisation leave;\nOther medical benefits, such as insurance and dental benefits;\nProbation period\n(if applicable) and notice period; and\nPlace of work (optional but encouraged to include this if this is different from the employer’s address).\nCommon key employment terms such as leave policy or medical benefits can be provided in an employee handbook or the company intranet. Setting all of these out clearly will be useful in preventing employment disputes from arising.\nWhat other employment rights do interns in Singapore have?\nFor interns that earn a monthly basic allowance of $2,600 and below, the Employment Act also provides for required rest days, hours of work and other conditions of service.\nRest days\nInterns are allowed at least one rest day every week. This could be Sunday or any other day determined from time to time by the employer. If the rest day is determined by the employer, the employer has to prepare a roster before the start of every month so that the intern is informed of the appointed rest days for that month.\nFor interns engaged in shift work, the employer may consider any continuous period of 30 hours as a rest day, provided that this continuous period of 30 hours commences at any time before 6 pm on a Sunday.\nInterns cannot be made to work on a rest day unless he is engaged in work that has to be carried on continuously by a succession of shifts. If they do work on their rest days, they must be paid accordingly.\nThis table explains how much an intern has to be paid if the employer requests work from the intern on a rest day:\nPeriod of work on rest day\nIntern’s payment\nUp to half the intern’s normal hours of work per day\nBasic rate of pay for 1 day’s work\nMore than half but up to the intern’s normal hours of work per day\nBasic rate of 2 days’ work\nMore than the intern’s normal hours of work per day\nSum of the basic rate of 2 days’ work and the rate of not less than 1.5 times his hourly basic rate of pay for each hour or part thereof which exceed the intern’s normal hours of work per day\nFor instance, this would be the calculation if an intern is asked to work 11 hours on a rest day which is more than the intern’s normal 8 hours of work on a working day:\n2(x) + 1.5(3x/8) where x is the salary for one day of work on a rest day.\nThis table explains how much an intern has to be paid if the intern requests work from the employer on a rest day:\nPeriod of work on rest day\nIntern’s payment\nMore than half the intern’s normal hours of work per day\nBasic rate of pay for half a normal day’s work\nMore than half but up to the intern’s normal hours of work per day\nBasic rate of pay for 1 day’s work\nMore than the intern’s normal hours of work per day\nSum of the basic rate of 1 day’s work and the rate of not less than 1.5 times his hourly basic rate of pay for each hour or part thereof which exceed the intern’s normal hours of work per day\nFor instance, this would be the calculation if an intern requested to work 11 hours on a rest day which is more than the intern’s normal 8 hours of work on a working day:\nx + 1.5(3x/8) where x is the salary for one day of work on a rest day.\nHours of work and break entitlements\nGenerally, an intern must not be required to work more than 6 consecutive hours without being able to take a break. They should also not be required to work more than 8 hours in one day or more than 44 hours in one week.\nAn intern may be required to exceed these limits only if there are exceptional situations such as where there is an accident (actual or threatened), urgent work to be done to machinery or a plant, or the nature of the work is essential for defence or security.\nFurther, where an intern is engaged in work which must be carried on continuously such as the security industry, the intern may be required to work for 8 consecutive hours inclusive of a meal break of at least 45 minutes.\nWhile employers and employees have some flexibility on the number of working hours and days per week, no intern may be required to work more than 9 hours a day or 44 hours in one week or for more than 88 hours in any continuous period of 2 weeks.\nWithin these limits, employers and interns may agree on modifications to the number of working hours or days in a week in the employment contract.\nOvertime hours\nIf the employer requests that the intern works for a longer period of time otherwise than permitted above, the employer must pay the intern overtime pay at the rate of not less than 1.5 times his hourly basic rate of pay.\nHowever, even then, an intern is not permitted to work more than 72 hours of overtime a month.\nConsequences of breaching interns’ employment rights\nIf you fail to pay the required allowance or contravene any other of your intern’s employment rights above, you will be guilty of an offence under the Employment Act. Upon conviction, you will be liable for a fine of up to $5,000.\nFor a repeat offence, you can be liable for a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both.\nEmployment Rights of Trainees in Singapore\nWhether trainees are entitled to employment rights depends on the type of contract they have signed.\nIf they have signed a contract of service that contains terms such as the KETs listed above, and which requires them to assist with actual work for the firm, then they are likely to have employment rights.\nOn the other hand, trainees may not be entitled to employment rights if their contract:\nStates that they are to be given training assignments (as opposed to actual work)\nDoes not include clauses that suggest that they are an employee (such as clauses relating to rights to terminate the contract)\nNeither will they be entitled to CPF contributions.\nFor example, Workforce Singapore has clarified that trainees under the SGUnited Traineeships programme (which ended in March 2022) are not considered employees, and that hirers also need not make CPF contributions for them.\nNevertheless, hirers are encouraged to treat trainees not protected under the Employment Act fairly. This can be by offering allowances, annual leave and sick leave on a goodwill basis.\nHirers should also take note that:\nHirers may need to pay their trainees a minimum monthly training allowance amount\nto qualify for training allowance support. For example, under the now-defunct SGUnited Traineeships Programme, hirers were required to pay trainees a certain minimum monthly training allowance to qualify for 80% training allowance support. The allowance amount was to be determined by the trainee’s educational qualifications.\nHirers are still responsible for ensuring safe workplaces for trainees (and interns).\nTrainees (and interns) who suffer injury at the workplace may be able to\nclaim work injury compensation\n.\n—\nInterns have employment rights under the Employment Act so long as they are hired under a contract of service. When entering into such a contract with your intern, you should set out all their employment rights clearly in writing.\nDuring the term of the intern’s employment with your company, you should be cautious and seek to abide by all their employment rights. If not, you could be reported to the Ministry of Manpower and convicted of employment offences. Such negative publicity could also tarnish your company’s reputation.\nOn the other hand, trainees may have fewer rights if they are not considered employees under the Employment Act. However, hirers are encouraged to offer them allowances and non-monetary benefits on a goodwill basis.\nA lawyer will be able to advise you on the employment rights of the interns and trainees that you will be hiring, and ensure that all the terms in your contracts with them are in accordance with their rights.\nIt is therefore highly encouraged for you to\nseek an employment lawyer\nto assist in the drafting of all contracts for hiring interns and trainees.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

They should also not be required to work more than 8 hours in one day or more than 44 hours in one week.\nAn intern may be required to exceed these limits only if there are exceptional situations such as where there is an accident (actual or threatened), urgent work to be done to machinery or a plant, or the nature of the work is essential for defence or security.\nFurther, where an intern is engaged in work which must be carried on continuously such as the security industry, the intern may be required to work for 8 consecutive hours inclusive of a meal break of at least 45 minutes.\nWhile employers and employees have some flexibility on the number of working hours and days per week, no intern may be required to work more than 9 hours a day or 44 hours in one week or for more than 88 hours in any continuous period of 2 weeks.\nWithin these limits, employers and interns may agree on modifications to the number of working hours or days in a week in the employment contract.\nOvertime hours\nIf the employer requests that the intern works for a longer period of time otherwise than permitted above, the employer must pay the intern overtime pay at the rate of not less than 1.5 times his hourly basic rate of pay.\nHowever, even then, an intern is not permitted to work more than 72 hours of overtime a month.\nConsequences of breaching interns’ employment rights\nIf you fail to pay the required allowance or contravene any other of your intern’s employment rights above, you will be guilty of an offence under the Employment Act. Upon conviction, you will be liable for a fine of up to $5,000.\nFor a repeat offence, you can be liable for a fine of up to $10,000, imprisonment for up to 12 months or to both.\nEmployment Rights of Trainees in Singapore\nWhether trainees are entitled to employment rights depends on the type of contract they have signed.\nIf they have signed a contract of service that contains terms such as the KETs listed above, and which requires them to assist with actual work for the firm, then they are likely to have employment rights.\nOn the other hand, trainees may not be entitled to employment rights if their contract:\nStates that they are to be given training assignments (as opposed to actual work)\nDoes not include clauses that suggest that they are an employee (such as clauses relating to rights to terminate the contract)\nNeither will they be entitled to CPF contributions.\nFor example, Workforce Singapore has clarified that trainees under the SGUnited Traineeships programme (which ended in March 2022) are not considered employees, and that hirers also need not make CPF contributions for them.\nNevertheless, hirers are encouraged to treat trainees not protected under the Employment Act fairly. This can be by offering allowances, annual leave and sick leave on a goodwill basis.\nHirers should also take note that:\nHirers may need to pay their trainees a minimum monthly training allowance amount\nto qualify for training allowance support. For example, under the now-defunct SGUnited Traineeships Programme, hirers were required to pay trainees a certain minimum monthly training allowance to qualify for 80% training allowance support. The allowance amount was to be determined by the trainee’s educational qualifications.\nHirers are still responsible for ensuring safe workplaces for trainees (and interns).\nTrainees (and interns) who suffer injury at the workplace may be able to\nclaim work injury compensation\n.\n—\nInterns have employment rights under the Employment Act so long as they are hired under a contract of service. When entering into such a contract with your intern, you should set out all their employment rights clearly in writing.\nDuring the term of the intern’s employment with your company, you should be cautious and seek to abide by all their employment rights. If not, you could be reported to the Ministry of Manpower and convicted of employment offences. Such negative publicity could also tarnish your company’s reputation.\nOn the other hand, trainees may have fewer rights if they are not considered employees under the Employment Act. However, hirers are encouraged to offer them allowances and non-monetary benefits on a goodwill basis.\nA lawyer will be able to advise you on the employment rights of the interns and trainees that you will be hiring, and ensure that all the terms in your contracts with them are in accordance with their rights.\nIt is therefore highly encouraged for you to\nseek an employment lawyer\nto assist in the drafting of all contracts for hiring interns and trainees.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

The EA\ncovers all employees in Singapore\nexcept for seafarers, domestic workers and public servants. These groups are protected through other regulations.\nUnder the EA, a salary is defined as all remuneration, including allowances, payable to an employee for the work done under a contract of service. However, the following items are not considered part of your salary:\nCost of accommodations, electricity, water or medical bills;\nContributions to any pension or provident fund made by your employer;\nTravel allowances;\nReimbursements\nfor special expenses incurred during employment;\nAny sum payable on discharge from employment or retirement; and\nAny retrenchment benefits.\nIn Singapore, salary should be paid in legal tender. This means that your salary must be in fiat money, whether by cheque or a direct transfer into your account. Your salary cannot be paid in the form of meals, accommodation, allowances or privileges.\nHowever, this does not mean that your employer cannot provide you with these benefits in addition to your wages.\nIs there a Minimum Wage in Singapore?\nThere is generally no minimum wage in Singapore. Your salary amount is a matter of negotiation between your employer and yourself or your trade union. However, a Progressive Wage Model applies to prescribe minimum wages to employees in certain sectors such as the cleaning sector.\nLearn more about the\nProgressive Wage Model’s minimum wage requirements\nin our other article.\nBy When Must Your Salary be Paid?\nYour salary must be paid within 7 days after the end of the salary period. Salary for overtime work must be paid within 14 days after the end of the salary period.\nA salary period refers to the period in which the salary that you earned is payable. Typically, a salary period is a month. However, the EA allows an employer to fix any salary period it desires so long as the salary period does not exceed 1 month.\nFor example, if your salary period is fixed on 30 January 2024, your salary must be paid to you latest by 6 February 2024 and your overtime salary by 13 February 2024.\nIf you resigned or were dismissed from employment, the date of the final salary payment will depend on the circumstances of your departure from the company.\nIf you were dismissed for misconduct,\nyou must be paid on your last day of work or within 3 working days of dismissal.\nIf you resigned and served your required notice period,\nyou must be paid on your last day of work.\nIf you resigned and did not serve your required notice period,\nyou must be paid within 7 days of your last day at work.\nHow is Salary Calculated?\nAn employee’s salary should generally be calculated according to his or her salary period. For example, if the salary period is 1 month, then the employee should be paid 1 month’s worth of salary.\nHowever, there are instances when monthly-rated employees may not be able to work during the whole of their salary period. For example, when a new employee starts work in the middle of the month or was on unpaid leave.\nIn such circumstances, the EA provides that such employees only be paid for the number of days that they work in that month. Thus, the salary is calculated according to the following formula:\nGross Monthly Pay\n(Your monthly pay excluding any allowances, reimbursements and overtime, bonus and productivity incentives)\nx\nNumber of days worked that month\n(Includes public holidays, paid hospitalisation and annual leave)\nTotal number of working days in the month\n(Excludes rest days, but includes public holidays)\nIf the employee had worked for less than 5 hours on that day, that day is to be considered half a working day and should be counted as 0.5 per half day worked.\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has provided a\nhandy calculator\nto help you calculate your pay for an incomplete month of work.\nThere are also situations when you may need to know your daily rate of pay. These situations are described, along with the methodology used to calculate the daily rates, below:\nBasic rate of pay method\n: This is used for calculating salary for\nwork on a public holiday\nor rest day and excludes allowances, reimbursements or overtime, bonus and productivity incentive payments.\nGross rate of pay method\n: This is used for calculating salary in lieu of notice of termination of service, salary in lieu of annual leave, paid public holidays, approved paid leave or deductions for unauthorised absence from work. This includes allowances, but excludes travel, food and housing allowances, reimbursements or overtime, bonus and productivity incentives payments.\nTo calculate your daily rate of pay using either method, you must use the following formula:\n12 x monthly basic or gross rate of pay / 52 x average number of days an employee is required to work in a week\nWill There be Any Deductions from My Salary?\nYour employer is not allowed to deduct any salary from you unless it is:\nAuthorised by the EA;\nAn order by the court or any other competent authority; or\nFor the recovery of any income, property or Goods and Services Tax (GST).\nThe EA permits your employer to make deductions for:\nAny unpaid absence from work;\nDamage or loss to any goods which the employee is responsible for;\nThe supply of accommodation, amenities or any other services (with your written consent);\nAny advance of salary, loans, or other unearned employment benefits;\nCPF contributions\n;\nAny payment to a registered cooperative society made on your behalf (with your written consent); and\nAny other deductions for which you have given consent.\nIf you are a foreign worker, your employer is not allowed to deduct from your salary for any reason unless it has your written consent and has informed MOM of the change in your salary. Further, your employer is not allowed the following deductions for any of the following reasons even if you have consented to them:\nAs a condition of your employment or continuing employment; or\nFor costs related to your employment, such as work pass renewal, security bond, medical insurance, repatriation costs, compulsory training, medical fees or levy payments.\nIs there a limit on the amount of salary to be deducted?\nThe EA prevents your employer from deducting more than 50% of your salary in any one salary period. However, this limit does not apply to deductions:\nFor absence from work;\nFor the recovery of advances, loans or unearned employment benefits;\nFor payments made to registered co-operative societies;\nMade to your final salary in the event of termination of employment.\nMust My Employer Issue Me an Itemised Payslip?\nAll employers are required to provide an itemised payslip, whether in soft or hard copy, and must be provided within 3 working days of salary payment at the latest. The itemised payslip should include the following items, unless they do not apply to you:\nEmployer’s and employee’s full name;\nDate of payment;\nBasic salary;\nStart and end date of the salary period;\nAny allowances paid during the salary period;\nAdditional payments, such as bonuses, rest day pay or public holiday pay;\nAny deductions;\nOvertime hours worked and overtime pay;\nStart and end date of the overtime payment period (if different from that of the salary period); and\nTotal net salary paid.\nWhat Can I Do If My Employer…\n1. Refused to pay me my agreed salary or made late salary payment?\nNon-payment of salary is an offence under the EA. An employer who refuses to pay salary can be fined between S$3,000 and S$15,000, or jailed for 6 months, or both. These maximum penalties are doubled if your employer is a repeat offender.\nFurther, you can\nclaim for your unpaid salary\nthrough the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) or approach your union for help. The TADM provides mediation and advisory services for salary-related claims, amongst other types of claims.\nYou should file your claim early as there is a limit of S$20,000 per claim or S$30,000 for claims by union members with their union’s assistance. Should you delay filing the claim, and therefore allow your unpaid salary to accumulate, you might exceed this limit and will have to forego any excess.\nIf you are still employed by the same employer, you can claim within 1 year of the non-payment. Otherwise, the claim must be filed within 6 months from your last day of work.\n2. Made an unauthorised deduction from my salary?\nIf your employer has made an unauthorised deduction and you are an employee covered by the EA, you should\nclaim for the unauthorised deduction\nthrough TADM.\nFor more information on the procedure for bringing a claim to TADM, please refer to our article on\ngetting help for employment disputes\n.\n—\nOur salaries enable us to put food on the table, maintain a roof over our heads, and pay our bills.

Employees have it easy – for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents (PRs) who are contractually employed, their CPF contributions are made on their behalf by their employers.\nHowever, if you are an employer and are confused about the specifics of employee/employer CPF contributions, let us break this down for you.\nWhat are Employee and Employer CPF Contributions?\nAs an employer, every month, you must contribute two portions of money to your employees’ CPF accounts. This includes:\nThe employee’s contribution; and\nThe employer’s contribution.\nThe amounts you have to contribute depend on factors such as your employees’ wages and their ages (explained below)\n.\nAs an employer, you are entitled to recover the employee’s share of the mandatory CPF contributions if your employees are earning more than $500 per month\n.\nAll you have to do is deduct the amount from the employee’s wages after making the CPF contributions for that particular month.\nThe following infographic summarises which employees employers must make CPF contributions to, as well as for which payments and leaves are CPF contributions applicable. You may click on it to download the image in a new tab.\nMust I Pay CPF Contribution for All Employees?\nNo, you do not have to make CPF contributions for all employees.\nIn order to be entitled to CPF contributions, an employee must:\nBe a Singaporean citizen, or a Singapore PR\nBe employed in Singapore\nHave signed a contract of service with an employer\nNot\nbe employed as a master, seaman or an apprentice in any shipping vessel\n(unless the employment contract does not exempt you from making CPF contributions for that employee)\nDoes the type of employment matter?\nYes. In general, employees can receive CPF contributions if they are of the following employment types (and provided that they also fulfil the criteria mentioned above):\nFull-time employees\nPart-time employees earning total wages of more than $50/month\nTemporary/casual employees earning total wages of more than $50/month\nThis is even if the employee has more than one employer, or is your family member.\nWhom do I not have to pay CPF for?\nYou do not have to pay CPF for the following groups of people:\nForeign employees (Holders of an Employment Pass, S pass, Miscellaneous Work Pass or Work Permit)\nSingaporean/Singaporean PRs who are posted overseas (but you may voluntarily pay CPF for them nevertheless)\nRegistered Partners of a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or Limited Partnership (LP) (unless engaged under an employment contract within the partnership)\nWhat Payments/Leave Do and Do Not Attract Employee CPF Contribution?\nIn general, you will have to make CPF contributions to your employees’ CPF accounts for the following types of payments:\nBasic salary\nOvertime pay\n(only for workmen and employees whose basic salary per month does not exceed $4,500 and $2,600, respectively)\nCash incentives:\nPayments for good work and attendance\nLong Service Awards\nProductivity Awards\nAllowances:\nMeal expenses\nEducation-related expenses for your employees’ children\nTransport expenses\nCash gifts given to employees during festive seasons etc.\nBonuses\nCommissions\n(payments that are based on the percentage of sales achieved)\nAnnual Leave Pay\n(payments made in lieu of leave)\nThere are also certain payments that\ndo not\nattract employee CPF contributions, such as the following:\nReimbursements\nfor\n:\nExpenses your employee incurs on behalf of your company\nCourses that are part of your employee’s training programme\nMoney spent on entertaining your company’s clients etc.\nGifts:\nSmall tokens\nGifts to congratulate employees on their marriage or to commemorate the birth of their children\nCompensation:\nCompensation for injuries approved under the\nWork Injury Compensation Act\nTermination benefits:\nRetirement gratuity\nRetrenchment pay\nSeverance pay\nCompensation for loss of employment etc.\nWhat are the Employee CPF Contribution Rates?\n“CPF contribution rate” refers to the method used to calculate the CPF contribution you should be making for your employees.\nYour employees will have different CPF contribution rates, depending on their:\nCitizenship status\n(Singapore citizen, PR for 3 years and above, or PR for 2 years and below)\nAge group\nTotal wages for the month\n(sum of Ordinary Wages and Additional Wages)\nSector\n(i.e. private or public sector)\nOrdinary and Additional Wages\nOrdinary Wages (OW) refer to the wages an employee has earned through their employment in 1 month. An example of this is the monthly salary you pay to your employees.\nAdditional Wages (AW) refer to wages which are either:\nNot granted wholly/exclusively for the month; or\nMade at intervals of more than a month\nExamples of AW include annual bonuses and leave pay.\nCPF contribution ceilings\nOW and AW are important as they both have “ceilings” that limit the amount of CPF contribution that your employee can receive.\nOW ceiling\nThe OW ceiling is capped at $8,000. This means that if an employee’s monthly salary is $8,500, his/her monthly CPF contribution will only be calculated based on an OW of $8,000. You will not need to pay a CPF contribution on the remaining $500.\nAW ceiling\nThe AW ceiling can be found by using the following equation:\n$102,000 – Total OW for the year\nThis means that if an employee’s monthly salary is $5,000, his/her AW ceiling will be:\n$102,000 – ($5,000 x 12) = $42,000.\nSo if you happen to give this particular employee a $45,000 bonus, his/her CPF contribution will only be calculated based on an AW of $42,000. You will not have to pay a CPF contribution on the remaining $3,000.\nCalculating CPF contributions\nCPF contribution rates can be calculated according to the table below:\nEmployee’s age\nContribution Rates from 1 January 2026 Based on %\n(for monthly wages ≥ $750)\nBy employer\nBy employee\nTotal\n55 and below\n17\n20\n37\nAbove 55 to 60\n16\n18\n34\nAbove 60 to 65\n12.5\n12.5\n25\nAbout 65 to 70\n9\n7.5\n16.5\nAbove 70\n7.5\n5\n12.5\nSince it may be difficult to manually calculate the CPF contributions of employees who vary in age and have different monthly salaries, the CPF Board has created an online\nCPF contribution calculator\n.\nAll you have to do is key in the necessary information, such as each employee’s birthday, and the OW and AW each employee has received for that particular month, and the calculator will compute how much you will have to contribute to your employee’s CPF account.\nHow to Pay Employee CPF Contributions\nYou can pay employee CPF contributions online, via\nCPF EZPay\n.\nIn order to use CPF EZPay, you will need:\nA SingPass/CorpPass account\nA CPF Submission Number (CSN) for your transactions with the CPF Board\nOnce you have access to CPF EZPay, you will need the following details regarding your employees in order to pay their CPF contributions:\nCPF Account Numbers\nFull names\nOW and AW\nDate of Birth\nCitizenship Status (Singaporean, or Singapore PR)\nAfter you key in the details listed above, the system will automatically calculate the CPF contributions that you will have to make for each employee, based on their wages, citizenship status and ages. You can then make the payments via Direct Debit or eNETS.\nWhen Must I Pay My Employee CPF Contributions?\nYou must pay your employees’ CPF contributions at the end of every month. If you have forgotten to pay the contributions, don’t worry – you have a 2-week grace period after the deadline to do so.\nFor example, if you forgot to pay the contributions on the 31st of January, you will have up till 14th February to pay the contribution. If the 14th of February happens to fall on a weekend or public holiday, you can pay by the next working day.\nIf you have yet to pay your employees’ CPF contributions after this grace period has ended, you will have to pay a late payment interest of 18% per annum (1.5% per month) starting from the first day of the following month. Following the example provided above, you will have to start paying interest from 1st March onwards.\nWhat Happens If I Paid My Employee Incorrectly?\nBefore you begin any of the below-mentioned procedures, please note that:\nThe refund or adjustment must be applied within 1 year from the date of payment.\nYou must have notified all affected employees about the refund or adjustment.\nThe adjustment or refund is subject to the availability of funds in the employee’s CPF account.\nAccidentally submitting CPF contributions twice\nIf you have accidentally paid CPF contributions twice in the same month, you can\napply for a full refund of the extra submission online\n. Before you do so, you must inform all affected employees that you will be applying for a refund.\nOver-contribution to your employees’ CPF accounts\nIf you have over-contributed for your employees, you can similarly a\npply for a refund of the excess contribution\nonline\n.\nDo note that from February 2024, any CPF contributions paid in excess of the CPF Annual Limit will be automatically refunded. Notifications will be sent after the refund is processed. However, it is recommended that you do not wait for the annual automatic refund. If you have paid excess CPF contributions above the CPF Annual Limit, you should apply for a refund promptly.\nUnderpayment/Omission of CPF contributions\nIf you have underpaid/omitted to pay employees’ CPF contributions, you can pay the difference via ‘Submit ad hoc CPF payments’ in CPF EZPay. Make sure you do this before the 14-day grace period is up, or you will have to pay the late payment interest as mentioned previously.\nAccidentally indicating the wrong details\nIf you have accidentally indicated the wrong details when making a CPF submission, such as by indicating the wrong month or CPF Submission Number, you can amend or delete your submission via CPF EZPay.\nWhat Happens If I Fail to Pay/Underpaid Employee CPF Contributions?\nIf you fail to pay or underpaid employee CPF contributions, there is a chance that your employees may report you to the authorities.\nIf you are a first-time offender who is found guilty of failing to pay or underpaying employee CPF contributions, you can face a fine of up to $5,000, and/or an imprisonment term of up to 6 months.\nRepeat offenders will face harsher penalties – you could be fined up to $10,000 and/or face an imprisonment term of up to 12 months\n.\nAlternatively, if you have deducted your employees’ share of CPF contributions but fail to pay the same amount to the CPF Board, you can be fined up to $10,000 and/or face an imprisonment term of up to 7 years.\n—\nCPF is an incredibly important scheme that helps provide Singaporeans and Singapore PRs with a sense of security, as these savings come in handy for many things, from health crises to ensuring a peaceful retirement. As an employer, it is your duty to ensure that your employees receive the necessary CPF contributions every month.\nCPF law can be technical, and errors can attract financial penalties. To navigate the CPF regime with clarity and confidence, we suggest that you\nseek legal advice from an employment lawyer\nif you have any further questions or if you would like to better understand your obligations regarding CPF contributions.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Or should you be making a complaint to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)?\n—\nThe short answer is: yes, your boss can ask you to work on a public holiday.\nHowever, if you are\nconsidered an “employee” under the Employment Act\n, your boss is legally required to:\nPay you an extra day’s salary; or\nProvide you with a day off on another day (i.e. off in lieu).\n(Do we even *have* human rights in Singapore? Okay, kidding.) ⠀ You’re probably already well aware of this, but tomorrow is Vesak Day – a public holiday! Unfortunately, some of us may be called back by our bosses to continue working. This is legal but if you are a non-government employee, you will generally be entitled to 1 extra day’s pay. ⠀ This extra pay is calculated based on your basic rate of pay if the public holiday falls on a working day, or your gross rate of pay if the public holiday falls on a non-working day (i.e. weekends for most office people). (Also, gross rate of pay = basic pay rate + allowances.) ⠀ Alternatively, you and your boss can agree to let you make up your holiday on another day. Personally we would prefer the day off, but go for the option that works better for you!

Or should you be making a complaint to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)?\n—\nThe short answer is: yes, your boss can ask you to work on a public holiday.\nHowever, if you are\nconsidered an “employee” under the Employment Act\n, your boss is legally required to:\nPay you an extra day’s salary; or\nProvide you with a day off on another day (i.e. off in lieu).\n(Do we even *have* human rights in Singapore? Okay, kidding.) ⠀ You’re probably already well aware of this, but tomorrow is Vesak Day – a public holiday! Unfortunately, some of us may be called back by our bosses to continue working. This is legal but if you are a non-government employee, you will generally be entitled to 1 extra day’s pay. ⠀ This extra pay is calculated based on your basic rate of pay if the public holiday falls on a working day, or your gross rate of pay if the public holiday falls on a non-working day (i.e. weekends for most office people). (Also, gross rate of pay = basic pay rate + allowances.) ⠀ Alternatively, you and your boss can agree to let you make up your holiday on another day. Personally we would prefer the day off, but go for the option that works better for you!

{"chunk_id": "SLA_3d82a393", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "How to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employer Obligations > How to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter", "text": "How to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nLast updated on January 15, 2024\nWhen hiring, it is not uncommon for employers to require job applicants to provide references written by their former employers.\nIn the future, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will also make it compulsory for financial institutions (FIs) to conduct reference checks and respond to reference check requests on employees, based on a set of minimum mandatory information within a specified period of time. This is to prevent individuals who engage in misconduct in one firm, from moving on to another firm without disclosing their earlier misconduct to the prospective employer.\nAs references usually play an important role in helping employers decide whether to hire an applicant, employers are legally obliged to prepare references in a\nfair and accurate manner\n. What does this involve?\nContents of the Reference\nEmployers are not required to include all material facts about the employee in the reference. Rather, employers only have to exercise reasonable care to\ndisclose information related to what has already been disclosed\n. This is to the extent that to not disclose such related information would make the information already disclosed incomplete, inaccurate and unfair.\nFor example, if the reference mentions that the former employee had committed several disciplinary offences, relevant information to be stated in the reference would include:\nThe nature of the offences;\nWhen the offences were committed; and\nHow the offences were dealt with.\nEmployers are also required to exercise reasonable care to ensure that the\nfacts stated in the reference are true\n.\nIf the employer expresses any opinions in the reference, the opinions must be based on and supported by facts which are true.\nIn the case of FIs, once MAS’ proposal to mandate reference checks takes effect, FIs must minimally (request and) provide in a reference check the following information:\nThe former employee’s employment history with the FI, including:\nThe duration of employment;\nThe roles and job functions (including the last position held); and\nThe reason for the cessation of employment;\nCompliance information relating to the former employee’s fitness and propriety (unless there is a risk of tipping off the former employee which may compromise the integrity of investigations) including any:\nConcluded/ongoing investigations and the extent of consumer detriment from the wrongdoing if substantiated;\nBreaches of legal and regulatory requirements;\nDisciplinary action; and\nMisconduct reports;\nThe last four balanced scorecard grades assigned to the former employee (where applicable); and\n(For individuals working in the insurance sector), the persistency ratio of insurance policies sold by the former employee and the methodology used in computing the persistency ratio (where applicable and available).\nOverall Impression of the Employee from the Reference\nIn providing facts which are accurate in the reference, the employer must exercise reasonable care to ensure that the reference\ndoes not give an unfair or misleading overall impression\nof the employee as a whole.\nThis may occur when the employer is unfairly selective about the information to be disclosed in the reference. For example, the employer may choose to describe the times when the employee makes mistakes, leaving out the times when the employee performed well.\nThis would give a misleading overall impression that the employee is incompetent, even though the individual facts disclosed are true.\nDisclosure of Complaints Against the Employee in the Reference\nSome industries have a practice of requiring employer references to disclose complaints against employees. These industries include the insurance industry and the financial advisory industry (as discussed above).\nHowever, if no such industry practice exists, employers generally\nshould not include complaints or allegations\nagainst the employee if the employee did not know of them and was not given the opportunity to explain or defend himself against them.\nThis is especially so for complaints which were unsubstantiated and therefore dismissed without the employee being informed of them.\nIf the employer is obliged, for whatever reason, to disclose unsubstantiated complaints, the employer should state explicitly in the reference that the complaints mentioned in the reference were unsubstantiated and that the employee was not made aware of them.\nThe employer should also inform the employee of such complaints when preparing the reference.\nFurther Disclosure of Information\nThe legal obligations of employers relating to the preparation of references continue even after the reference has been written.\nFor example, after reading the reference, a prospective employer may contact the former employer of an applicant for further information or clarification. The former employer will then be obliged to provide further details as required to provide a complete, accurate and fair picture of the employee.\nCase Study\nIn\nRamesh s/o Krishnan v AXA Life Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd\n, the Court of Appeal held that an insurance company had been negligent in preparing a reference for one of its employees. This was because:\nBetween 2 financial measures relating to premium policies, the former employer had unfairly selected to disclose the measure giving the lower figure, even though the measure had never been used to assess the employee before. This gave rise to a false or mistaken inference (in the mind of a reasonable recipient of the reference) that the employee was incompetent. However, this was contrary to other evidence such as the accolades that the employee had won, indicating that he was one of the former employer’s best employees.\nWhen the former employer was contacted repeatedly to provide further information on the financial measures used, it failed to provide this information.\nThe former employer made 3 bare statements regarding the disciplinary offences involving the employee. As the former employer failed to provide further details, the nature and severity of the offences and the outcome of the investigations was not clear. This gave the misleading impression that the employee had been involved in serious misconduct.\nThe former employer had deliberately used very strong words to describe the employee’s possible ethical violations, highlighting the negative information about the employee even though the recipient of the reference had not requested for this.\n—\nIt is important for employers to familiarise themselves with this area of law to minimise incurring liability when writing references for their employees. The crux is to ensure the reference, both its overall impression and the individual facts it contains, is a\nfair and accurate representation of the employee\n.\nWhile employers need not guarantee that all the facts are true, they are expected to exercise reasonable care to ascertain its truth when including them in the reference. For example, in describingthe employee’s role in a project that the writer of the reference was not involved in, the writer should corroborate the information with the people involved in the project.\nIn addition, employers should avoid choosing a certain type of facts to portray the employee in a certain manner which is untrue. Employers who wish to use strong, evocative words to describe the employee in a certain manner should be prepared to substantiate these claims as they will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny.\nFinally, remember that these duties also extend to the disclosure of further information when requested for by prospective employers.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

This is to the extent that to not disclose such related information would make the information already disclosed incomplete, inaccurate and unfair.\nFor example, if the reference mentions that the former employee had committed several disciplinary offences, relevant information to be stated in the reference would include:\nThe nature of the offences;\nWhen the offences were committed; and\nHow the offences were dealt with.\nEmployers are also required to exercise reasonable care to ensure that the\nfacts stated in the reference are true\n.\nIf the employer expresses any opinions in the reference, the opinions must be based on and supported by facts which are true.\nIn the case of FIs, once MAS’ proposal to mandate reference checks takes effect, FIs must minimally (request and) provide in a reference check the following information:\nThe former employee’s employment history with the FI, including:\nThe duration of employment;\nThe roles and job functions (including the last position held); and\nThe reason for the cessation of employment;\nCompliance information relating to the former employee’s fitness and propriety (unless there is a risk of tipping off the former employee which may compromise the integrity of investigations) including any:\nConcluded/ongoing investigations and the extent of consumer detriment from the wrongdoing if substantiated;\nBreaches of legal and regulatory requirements;\nDisciplinary action; and\nMisconduct reports;\nThe last four balanced scorecard grades assigned to the former employee (where applicable); and\n(For individuals working in the insurance sector), the persistency ratio of insurance policies sold by the former employee and the methodology used in computing the persistency ratio (where applicable and available).\nOverall Impression of the Employee from the Reference\nIn providing facts which are accurate in the reference, the employer must exercise reasonable care to ensure that the reference\ndoes not give an unfair or misleading overall impression\nof the employee as a whole.\nThis may occur when the employer is unfairly selective about the information to be disclosed in the reference. For example, the employer may choose to describe the times when the employee makes mistakes, leaving out the times when the employee performed well.\nThis would give a misleading overall impression that the employee is incompetent, even though the individual facts disclosed are true.\nDisclosure of Complaints Against the Employee in the Reference\nSome industries have a practice of requiring employer references to disclose complaints against employees. These industries include the insurance industry and the financial advisory industry (as discussed above).\nHowever, if no such industry practice exists, employers generally\nshould not include complaints or allegations\nagainst the employee if the employee did not know of them and was not given the opportunity to explain or defend himself against them.\nThis is especially so for complaints which were unsubstantiated and therefore dismissed without the employee being informed of them.\nIf the employer is obliged, for whatever reason, to disclose unsubstantiated complaints, the employer should state explicitly in the reference that the complaints mentioned in the reference were unsubstantiated and that the employee was not made aware of them.\nThe employer should also inform the employee of such complaints when preparing the reference.\nFurther Disclosure of Information\nThe legal obligations of employers relating to the preparation of references continue even after the reference has been written.\nFor example, after reading the reference, a prospective employer may contact the former employer of an applicant for further information or clarification. The former employer will then be obliged to provide further details as required to provide a complete, accurate and fair picture of the employee.\nCase Study\nIn\nRamesh s/o Krishnan v AXA Life Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd\n, the Court of Appeal held that an insurance company had been negligent in preparing a reference for one of its employees. This was because:\nBetween 2 financial measures relating to premium policies, the former employer had unfairly selected to disclose the measure giving the lower figure, even though the measure had never been used to assess the employee before. This gave rise to a false or mistaken inference (in the mind of a reasonable recipient of the reference) that the employee was incompetent. However, this was contrary to other evidence such as the accolades that the employee had won, indicating that he was one of the former employer’s best employees.\nWhen the former employer was contacted repeatedly to provide further information on the financial measures used, it failed to provide this information.\nThe former employer made 3 bare statements regarding the disciplinary offences involving the employee. As the former employer failed to provide further details, the nature and severity of the offences and the outcome of the investigations was not clear. This gave the misleading impression that the employee had been involved in serious misconduct.\nThe former employer had deliberately used very strong words to describe the employee’s possible ethical violations, highlighting the negative information about the employee even though the recipient of the reference had not requested for this.\n—\nIt is important for employers to familiarise themselves with this area of law to minimise incurring liability when writing references for their employees. The crux is to ensure the reference, both its overall impression and the individual facts it contains, is a\nfair and accurate representation of the employee\n.\nWhile employers need not guarantee that all the facts are true, they are expected to exercise reasonable care to ascertain its truth when including them in the reference. For example, in describingthe employee’s role in a project that the writer of the reference was not involved in, the writer should corroborate the information with the people involved in the project.\nIn addition, employers should avoid choosing a certain type of facts to portray the employee in a certain manner which is untrue. Employers who wish to use strong, evocative words to describe the employee in a certain manner should be prepared to substantiate these claims as they will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny.\nFinally, remember that these duties also extend to the disclosure of further information when requested for by prospective employers.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Where no such agreement exists, or if you are self-employed, this 12-month period will be according to a calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December of the year)\n.\nThese entitlements apply regardless of how many children one has, and will not be increased based on that number.\nShould both parents be employees of the same employer, they will each still be entitled to 6 days of childcare leave and 2 days of extended childcare leave, if applicable (see below) and given that they meet the eligibility criteria.\nHowever, do note that\na\nmale employee is not entitled\nto government-paid (or unpaid) childcare leave\nif\n:\nHe is the biological father of the child; and\nEither he or the biological mother of the child was married to another person, or both of them were not lawfully married to each other, at the time the child was conceived (E.g., in cases of extramarital affair).\nThe is unless the male employee subsequently marries the biological mother of the child, in which case he will be entitled to government-paid (or unpaid) childcare leave.\nAm I entitled to childcare leave if my child is not a Singapore citizen?\nWorking parents of children who are non-citizens are eligible for 2 days of paid childcare leave for every 12-month period in accordance with the Employment Act, subject to them meeting the eligibility requirements mentioned above.\nWhat if I’m not the biological parent of the child?\nFor a working parent to be eligible for childcare leave, it does not matter whether the working parent’s child is his/her birth child, stepchild or adopted child. However,\nadoptive parents will be eligible for paid childcare leave only after the\nAdoption Order has been passed\n.\nFoster parents\nand\nlegal guardians\ndo not qualify as only parents are entitled to childcare leave\n.\nHow to determine your childcare leave entitlement\nIf you have neither just joined your employer nor intend to leave your company this year, you will be able to claim the full 6 days of childcare leave\nor 2 days of extended childcare leave\nyou are entitled to.\nHowever, if you have worked for your employer for less than a year or intend to leave your company this year, your childcare leave will be pro-rated according to your length of employment service for that year.\nIf you are a new hire who has been with your employer for less than a year,\nyour childcare leave entitlement will be as follows:\nCompleted months of employment service during relevant 12-month period\nEligible days of childcare leave\n0-2\nNot eligible\n3-4\n2\n5-6\n3\n7-8\n4\n9-10\n5\n11-12\n6\nIf you are intending to leave your company this year,\nyour childcare leave will also be pro-rated based on the number of completed months of employment service during this year of resignation or termination:\nCompleted months of employment service in the year of resignation or termination\nEligible days of childcare leave\n0-2\n2\n(Must have worked for at least 3 months before departure)\n3-4\n2\n5-6\n3\n7-8\n4\n9-10\n5\n11-12\n6\nWorking parents who are fixed-term contractors, temporary or part-time employees\ncan also be entitled to childcare leave. However, their leave entitlement is subject to the number of hours that they work and computed as follows:\nAverage number of hours a week the part-time employee works\n——————-\nAverage number of hours a week a similar full-time employee works\nx\nDays of childcare leave a similar full-time employee has, based on duration of employment\nx\nNumber of hours a day a similar full-time employee works\nFor example, a part-time worker who works an average of 4 hours a week, versus a full-time worker who works 8 hours a week, will be entitled to\n4.36 hours of childcare leave (4/44 x 6 x 8). Since the minimum number of days of childcare leave entitlement is 2 days, the part-time worker will, therefore, be entitled to 2 days of childcare leave at 4 hours each day.\nExtended childcare leave, however, cannot be pro-rated.\nTo check if you are entitled to childcare leave and how many days,\nyou may use\nMOM’s childcare leave calculator\n.\nHow Do Working Parents Apply for Childcare Leave?\nWorking parents who are employees\nare strongly encouraged to discuss their childcare leave plans with their employers early to avoid disappointment so the latter can also make alternative work arrangements.\nThey will need to download and complete the Government-Paid Childcare Leave (GPCL)\ndeclaration form\nand submit it to their current employers, along with any other necessary supporting documents when applying for childcare leave in accordance with company procedures.\nChildcare leave already claimed under previous employer(s) will be deducted from their overall yearly childcare leave entitlement.\nFor self-employed parents,\nthey should keep a log of their leave days and submit an online claim after their leave is taken via\nthe\nGovernment-Paid Leave Portal\nno later than 3\nmonths\nafter the last day of the calendar year.\nThey will be reimbursed by the government for up to 3 days of paid childcare leave and/or 2 days of extended childcare leave based on their Notice of Assessment submitted to the Inland Revenue Authority of\nSingapore (IRAS)\n.\nWhen Can Childcare Leave Not be Used?\nChildcare leave cannot be abused nor applied by working parents for personal use, or any other purpose other than for caring for their children.\nParents also cannot:\nTransfer or “share” childcare leave between themselves;\nHave any outstanding childcare leave unused within a 12-month period converted to cash or brought over to a new company;\nApply for no-pay leave and childcare leave simultaneously\n.\nWhat Happens to Any Unused Childcare Leave?\nAll unused childcare leave will lapse at the end of each agreed 12-month period and cannot be carried forward to the next year. Working parents cannot encash or claim allowance on any such unused childcare leave.\nWorking parents who are leaving the company are not allowed to use their childcare leave to offset any notice period for the\ntermination of employment\n. Also, should childcare leave be granted to them during the notice period, the leave taken will not lengthen the notice period that has to be\nserved.\nWhat If I’m Denied Childcare Leave or Childcare Leave Reimbursement Despite Being Entitled to It?\nFor employed working parents, it is possible that an employer may not be able to grant an employee’s request for childcare leave due to work. Therefore, employees are advised to communicate their childcare leave plans with their employers early. This way, employers are given sufficient notice and leeway to accommodate any leave requests as best and as early as they can.\nWhile childcare leave is subject to the employers’ approval, employers are legally required to grant childcare leave to a working parent who is entitled to and requests for such leave. An employer who unreasonably denies childcare leave will be fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned for a term of up to 6 months, or given both punishments\n.\nShould employed working parents feel they have been unfairly denied childcare leave or extended childcare leave, they may contact the\nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)\nfor mediation and advice on\ndispute management.\nFor self-employed working parents,\nthey may file a notice of dispute to the Minister for Social and Family Development if their claim for childcare leave reimbursement is rejected or deemed to have failed to comply with childcare leave laws.\nSuch a notice of dispute should be filed within a month from the date of dispute and, also:\nState the amount of reimbursement claimed by the applicant;\nState the grounds of dispute together with the decision of the Director or the Board, where applicable; and\nBe accompanied by any relevant supporting information or\ndocuments.\nAlternative Care Arrangements for Children Whose Parents are Unable to Take Paid Childcare Leave\nWorking parents who are unable to take childcare leave to care for their children may consider seeking alternative childcare arrangements such as placing their children at day-care centres, with babysitters, domestic helpers or relatives such as the children’s grandparents.\nIn the event that such alternative childcare arrangements are not feasible, it will be worthwhile and meaningful for working parents and employers to explore and encourage flexible work culture and arrangements that enable them to work from home.\nIn this digital and information age, such flexibility and work-life support can enhance employee engagement and commitment, thereby giving businesses\ncrucial competitive advantages.\n—\nIdeally, employers and employees should strive for greater empathy, understanding and more regular communication about their respective challenges in the workplace and at home so they can seek ways to better support each other.\nHowever, if one gets caught in a dispute with their employer over childcare leave, this can leave both the employer and employee in an exceptionally stressful situation.\nThankfully, when in doubt, there are also experienced\nemployment lawyers\non hand to advise the relevant parties on the best course of action to take.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Where no such agreement exists, or if you are self-employed, this 12-month period will be according to a calendar year (i.e. 1 January to 31 December of the year)\n.\nThese entitlements apply regardless of how many children one has, and will not be increased based on that number.\nShould both parents be employees of the same employer, they will each still be entitled to 6 days of childcare leave and 2 days of extended childcare leave, if applicable (see below) and given that they meet the eligibility criteria.\nHowever, do note that\na\nmale employee is not entitled\nto government-paid (or unpaid) childcare leave\nif\n:\nHe is the biological father of the child; and\nEither he or the biological mother of the child was married to another person, or both of them were not lawfully married to each other, at the time the child was conceived (E.g., in cases of extramarital affair).\nThe is unless the male employee subsequently marries the biological mother of the child, in which case he will be entitled to government-paid (or unpaid) childcare leave.\nAm I entitled to childcare leave if my child is not a Singapore citizen?\nWorking parents of children who are non-citizens are eligible for 2 days of paid childcare leave for every 12-month period in accordance with the Employment Act, subject to them meeting the eligibility requirements mentioned above.\nWhat if I’m not the biological parent of the child?\nFor a working parent to be eligible for childcare leave, it does not matter whether the working parent’s child is his/her birth child, stepchild or adopted child. However,\nadoptive parents will be eligible for paid childcare leave only after the\nAdoption Order has been passed\n.\nFoster parents\nand\nlegal guardians\ndo not qualify as only parents are entitled to childcare leave\n.\nHow to determine your childcare leave entitlement\nIf you have neither just joined your employer nor intend to leave your company this year, you will be able to claim the full 6 days of childcare leave\nor 2 days of extended childcare leave\nyou are entitled to.\nHowever, if you have worked for your employer for less than a year or intend to leave your company this year, your childcare leave will be pro-rated according to your length of employment service for that year.\nIf you are a new hire who has been with your employer for less than a year,\nyour childcare leave entitlement will be as follows:\nCompleted months of employment service during relevant 12-month period\nEligible days of childcare leave\n0-2\nNot eligible\n3-4\n2\n5-6\n3\n7-8\n4\n9-10\n5\n11-12\n6\nIf you are intending to leave your company this year,\nyour childcare leave will also be pro-rated based on the number of completed months of employment service during this year of resignation or termination:\nCompleted months of employment service in the year of resignation or termination\nEligible days of childcare leave\n0-2\n2\n(Must have worked for at least 3 months before departure)\n3-4\n2\n5-6\n3\n7-8\n4\n9-10\n5\n11-12\n6\nWorking parents who are fixed-term contractors, temporary or part-time employees\ncan also be entitled to childcare leave. However, their leave entitlement is subject to the number of hours that they work and computed as follows:\nAverage number of hours a week the part-time employee works\n——————-\nAverage number of hours a week a similar full-time employee works\nx\nDays of childcare leave a similar full-time employee has, based on duration of employment\nx\nNumber of hours a day a similar full-time employee works\nFor example, a part-time worker who works an average of 4 hours a week, versus a full-time worker who works 8 hours a week, will be entitled to\n4.36 hours of childcare leave (4/44 x 6 x 8). Since the minimum number of days of childcare leave entitlement is 2 days, the part-time worker will, therefore, be entitled to 2 days of childcare leave at 4 hours each day.\nExtended childcare leave, however, cannot be pro-rated.\nTo check if you are entitled to childcare leave and how many days,\nyou may use\nMOM’s childcare leave calculator\n.\nHow Do Working Parents Apply for Childcare Leave?\nWorking parents who are employees\nare strongly encouraged to discuss their childcare leave plans with their employers early to avoid disappointment so the latter can also make alternative work arrangements.\nThey will need to download and complete the Government-Paid Childcare Leave (GPCL)\ndeclaration form\nand submit it to their current employers, along with any other necessary supporting documents when applying for childcare leave in accordance with company procedures.\nChildcare leave already claimed under previous employer(s) will be deducted from their overall yearly childcare leave entitlement.\nFor self-employed parents,\nthey should keep a log of their leave days and submit an online claim after their leave is taken via\nthe\nGovernment-Paid Leave Portal\nno later than 3\nmonths\nafter the last day of the calendar year.\nThey will be reimbursed by the government for up to 3 days of paid childcare leave and/or 2 days of extended childcare leave based on their Notice of Assessment submitted to the Inland Revenue Authority of\nSingapore (IRAS)\n.\nWhen Can Childcare Leave Not be Used?\nChildcare leave cannot be abused nor applied by working parents for personal use, or any other purpose other than for caring for their children.\nParents also cannot:\nTransfer or “share” childcare leave between themselves;\nHave any outstanding childcare leave unused within a 12-month period converted to cash or brought over to a new company;\nApply for no-pay leave and childcare leave simultaneously\n.\nWhat Happens to Any Unused Childcare Leave?\nAll unused childcare leave will lapse at the end of each agreed 12-month period and cannot be carried forward to the next year. Working parents cannot encash or claim allowance on any such unused childcare leave.\nWorking parents who are leaving the company are not allowed to use their childcare leave to offset any notice period for the\ntermination of employment\n. Also, should childcare leave be granted to them during the notice period, the leave taken will not lengthen the notice period that has to be\nserved.\nWhat If I’m Denied Childcare Leave or Childcare Leave Reimbursement Despite Being Entitled to It?\nFor employed working parents, it is possible that an employer may not be able to grant an employee’s request for childcare leave due to work. Therefore, employees are advised to communicate their childcare leave plans with their employers early. This way, employers are given sufficient notice and leeway to accommodate any leave requests as best and as early as they can.\nWhile childcare leave is subject to the employers’ approval, employers are legally required to grant childcare leave to a working parent who is entitled to and requests for such leave.

If you have just received news of your employee’s death at work you might be wondering what are the steps you, as an employer in Singapore, should take.\nThis article will help to answer some questions you may have on this topic including:\nWhat you should do immediately upon an employee’s death in Singapore\nPayment of any monies or salary due\nPayment of maternity benefits where a female employee dies during maternity leave\nPayment of compensation\nReturning of employee’s belongings at the workplace to his/her family\nWhat to do if the deceased employee is a foreigner\nImmediate\nSteps\nAs an employer, there are some immediate steps you should take in situations where your employee’s death has occurred at the workplace, as well as outside of the workplace.\nWhere the employee’s death occurred at the workplace\nAn employee may die from non-work related causes while at work, such as suffering a fatal heart attack while in the office, or die as a result of work, such as a construction worker falling to his death from an unstable scaffold at a construction site.\nIf an employee dies at the workplace, employers must:\n1.\nNotify the Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health of the Ministry of Manpower via an\nonline form\nas soon as reasonably practicable\n.\nEmployers will need to provide details of the date and time of their employee’s death, place of death, name and identification number of their employee, and the workplace occupier where applicable. The workplace occupier is the person who has control of the premises which employees work in. Alternatively, in the case of a factory registered with MOM, the occupier is the person who holds the certificate of registration. The workplace occupier’s duty is to ensure that the workplace and equipment used are safe.\nEmployers will also need to describe the accident briefly, and leave their name and contact details.\n2.\nSubmit an incident report\nEmployers will need to submit an incident report to MOM using the\nWSH Incident Reporting eService\nwithin 10 days\nof the accident or occupational disease leading to the employee’s death.\n(Note: Employers must report their employee’s death even if they have missed the 10-day deadline, and provide reasons for late reporting in the incident report.)\nIn the incident report, employers will need to provide their personal particulars, company details and details of the accident or death.\nEmployers will also need to provide other details of their deceased employee, including his or her personal particulars, employment, and insurance.\nRemember to save or print the submitted report as employers are required to keep all incident reports for\n3 years.\nAfter employers have submitted an incident report, MOM may investigate the accident site and process work injury compensation claims.\n3.\nInform the insurer\nEmployers may also wish to inform their insurer about the death or accident as soon as they can, in order to get reimbursement from their insurer for any expenses that will be incurred.\nWhere the employee’s death occurred outside of the workplace\nIf the employee’s death occurs outside of the workplace, employers will still need to notify the Commissioner and submit an incident report, as described above, as long as the death of their employee is work-related.\nSuch scenarios include where:\nAn employee meets with a traffic accident while travelling during work or for work, regardless of the mode of transport. An example would be an employee meeting with a traffic accident while driving his own car or taking the bus to a company meeting.\nAn employee meets with a traffic accident while taking company transport to and fro his or her home and workplace.\nA seaman dies while onboard a Singapore-registered vessel, regardless of the location of the vessel.\nAn employee was injured in a work accident or contracted an occupational disease due to work exposure to biological or chemical agents and subsequently dies from the injury or disease outside the workplace.\nFailure to notify and report an accident or occupational disease leading to an employee’s death is an offence. An employer found guilty of this offence could face a fine of up to $5,000 for the first offence, and a fine of up to $10,000 and/or up to 6 months’ jail for subsequent offences.\nIf you had already submitted an incident report when your employee was injured in a work accident, or at the time he/she contracted an occupational disease, you do not need to submit it again in the unfortunate circumstances that the employee consequently dies. However, you still must notify the Commissioner\nimmediately.\nPayment of Any Monies or Salary Due\nA deceased employee may have accrued salary, and any other sums (such as public holiday pay), before his or her death. Employers should settle all outstanding employment issues, including the payment of any monies owed or salary due to the deceased employee.\nThe amount to be paid to your employee will depend on the employment contract signed between you and your employee. For employees who receive monthly payments, the amount should be calculated based on the number of days your employee had worked in that month until his death.\nThe salary can be paid into the deceased employee’s bank account. However, once the bank is notified of the deceased’s death, there will be an immediate “freeze” of the deceased employee’s bank account(s). In such circumstances, and if possible, you may want to contact the next-of-kin or the deceased’s personal representative on how to proceed with the payment of salary and other monies due.\nThe deceased’s personal representative is the person who is authorised to manage the deceased’s estate, whether via a Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of\nAdministration.\nPayment of Maternity Benefits Where a Female Employee Dies During Maternity Leave\nEvery female employee on\nmaternity leave\nis entitled to receive a form of payment, known as a maternity benefit, from her employer at her gross rate of pay.\nUnder\nsection 79 of the Employment Act\n, if a female employee is on maternity leave and dies from any cause\nbefore\nconfinement, her employer must pay her maternity benefit to the person nominated by her to receive such benefit, or her personal representative if there is no one nominated.\nThe amount of the maternity benefit payable is capped at 30 days’ worth of gross rate of pay, unless the duration of time from the employee’s last day of work to the day right before her death exceeds 30 days.\nIf the female employee dies\non or after the day\nof confinement and before any maternity benefit has been paid to her, the amount of maternity benefit to be paid is calculated from her last day of work up to the day before the day of her death, subtracting any maternity benefit that has already been paid to her. The payment must likewise be made to the female employee’s nominated person or her personal\nrepresentative.\nPayment of Compensation\nEmployers, or their insurers, may be required to\npay work injury compensation\nfor the employee’s death under the Workplace Injury Compensation Act (WICA).\nCompensation is limited to the disease, or injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment, that caused the employee’s death. This would include instances of death caused by meeting with an accident in a foreign country that the employee had been assigned to work in, and meeting with an accident while travelling to the workplace in a vehicle operated by or on behalf of the employer.\nCompensation for the employee’s death is payable to the deceased employee’s estate or to the benefit of his dependants (i.e. family members).\nIn addition, the WICA is a no-fault compensation scheme. This means that if the WICA claim by the employee’s dependants is successful, employers must make such work injury compensation regardless of whether they were at fault for the injury causing the employee’s death.\nThe employee’s dependants may claim a lump-sum compensation, with the amount\ncalculated\nfrom the employee’s average monthly earnings multiplied by an age multiplying factor.\nThe following compensation limits should also be noted:\nAccidents before 1 January 2020\nAccidents from 1 January 2020\nMinimum compensation\n$69,000\n$76,000\nMaximum compensation\n$204,000\n$225,000\nWhen is an employer not required to pay compensation under WICA?\nEmployers are not liable to pay compensation under WICA if the employee met with an accident leading to his death that was not workplace-related. Employers are also not liable to pay for compensation under WICA for domestic workers, independent contractors and uniformed personnel of the government.\nAdditionally, employers need not pay compensation under WICA if employees die after they:\nInjure themselves on purpose;\nDeliberately make an existing injury more serious; or\nInjure themselves when under the influence of alcohol or a prescription drug\nnot prescribed by a doctor.\nReturning of Employee’s Belongings at the Workplace to His/Her Family\nEmployers should arrange for the employee’s personal belongings at the workplace to be packed and delivered to the family, depending on how the family wishes for their loved one’s belongings to be\nhandled.\nWhat to Do If the Deceased Employee is a Foreigner\nInforming MOM and employee’s family of the death\nIf your foreign employee is a Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW), you are required to contact the police immediately upon her death. You also have to send your name, contact number, and your foreign worker’s name and Work Permit number to MOM\nvia this feedback form\nwithin 12 hours of knowing about the death.\nYou should also contact the employee’s family to inform them of the death as soon as practicable so that arrangements can be made. Such arrangements include paying any outstanding salaries or payments to the worker’s next-of-kin or your employee’s appointed trustee if he or she has one. There will be a section below on handling the employee’s body and belongings.\nRequesting to cancel work passes and permits\nThe Employment Pass (EP), S Pass or Work Permit of the deceased foreign employee must be cancelled within\n1 week\nafter the death of the employee, or\n1 day\nafter the applicable work pass or work permit expires, depending on which comes first.\nEither the employer or appointed employment agent can cancel the work pass or work permit. Employers must also return the cancelled work permit card within 1 week from cancellation by post.\nShould employers be unable to return the card, such as where the card is missing or damaged beyond repair, they can use the\nWP Online’s\n“card return” function to explain why they are unable to return the card.\nNote\n: Cancelling the main work pass will also cancel the Dependant’s Pass (DP), which will have implications on DP holders. You may refer to the section below for more information.\nRequesting to cancel work permits for FDWs\nEmployers of deceased FDWs are required to cancel their work permit immediately after informing MOM of the death. This may be done through the\nFDW eService\n.\nIf the employer does not have a valid SingPass to access the FDW eService, he or she can submit to MOM a\nrequest to cancel the work permit\nof the deceased helper. An authorised person can also submit the request on behalf of the employer.\nEmployers will need to upload a copy of the employee’s death certificate, as well as the airway bill, burial certificate or cremation certification where applicable. MOM will cancel the work permit within 3 working days of receiving the request.\nEmployers may also wish to apply for a domestic helper levy waiver\nhere\nwith a copy of the deceased’s death certificate. Employers can apply for it only after the levy has been charged and the application must be made within 1 year of the levy bill.\nBearing of costs in the handling of employee’s body and belongings\nDepending on what the foreign employee’s family decides, employers have to\nbear the cost\nof either:\nHaving the body buried in Singapore;\nCremating the body in Singapore and returning the ashes to the employee’s home country; or\nReturning the body to the employee’s home country.\nEmployers will also have to bear the cost of returning the foreign employee’s belongings to the family, as well as pay the family any outstanding salaries or monies due to the foreign employee.\nIf the employee’s family are on Dependant’s Passes in Singapore, does the employer need to pay for their repatriation?\nAs DP holders no longer have valid passes once the main work pass has been cancelled, they will need to leave Singapore. Employers are required to buy air tickets to send the DP holders to the international airport in their home country nearest to their hometown. This is unless a DP holder agrees in writing to bear the cost.\nEmployers can also\nrequest for a Short Term Visit Pass\n(STVP) to allow their employee’s family members who are DP holders to stay in Singapore for up to 30 days to settle their affairs. Once the pass expires, the family members must leave Singapore.\n—\nThe death of an employee is an unfortunate situation which may leave you feeling distressed and at a loss for what to do next. Once you are aware of your employee’s death and the circumstances surrounding the death, you can then proceed with the necessary steps.\nFor workplace-related deaths, you should immediately notify the Commissioner, or the police in the case of FDWs.

If you have just received news of your employee’s death at work you might be wondering what are the steps you, as an employer in Singapore, should take.\nThis article will help to answer some questions you may have on this topic including:\nWhat you should do immediately upon an employee’s death in Singapore\nPayment of any monies or salary due\nPayment of maternity benefits where a female employee dies during maternity leave\nPayment of compensation\nReturning of employee’s belongings at the workplace to his/her family\nWhat to do if the deceased employee is a foreigner\nImmediate\nSteps\nAs an employer, there are some immediate steps you should take in situations where your employee’s death has occurred at the workplace, as well as outside of the workplace.\nWhere the employee’s death occurred at the workplace\nAn employee may die from non-work related causes while at work, such as suffering a fatal heart attack while in the office, or die as a result of work, such as a construction worker falling to his death from an unstable scaffold at a construction site.\nIf an employee dies at the workplace, employers must:\n1.\nNotify the Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health of the Ministry of Manpower via an\nonline form\nas soon as reasonably practicable\n.\nEmployers will need to provide details of the date and time of their employee’s death, place of death, name and identification number of their employee, and the workplace occupier where applicable. The workplace occupier is the person who has control of the premises which employees work in. Alternatively, in the case of a factory registered with MOM, the occupier is the person who holds the certificate of registration. The workplace occupier’s duty is to ensure that the workplace and equipment used are safe.\nEmployers will also need to describe the accident briefly, and leave their name and contact details.\n2.\nSubmit an incident report\nEmployers will need to submit an incident report to MOM using the\nWSH Incident Reporting eService\nwithin 10 days\nof the accident or occupational disease leading to the employee’s death.\n(Note: Employers must report their employee’s death even if they have missed the 10-day deadline, and provide reasons for late reporting in the incident report.)\nIn the incident report, employers will need to provide their personal particulars, company details and details of the accident or death.\nEmployers will also need to provide other details of their deceased employee, including his or her personal particulars, employment, and insurance.\nRemember to save or print the submitted report as employers are required to keep all incident reports for\n3 years.\nAfter employers have submitted an incident report, MOM may investigate the accident site and process work injury compensation claims.\n3.\nInform the insurer\nEmployers may also wish to inform their insurer about the death or accident as soon as they can, in order to get reimbursement from their insurer for any expenses that will be incurred.\nWhere the employee’s death occurred outside of the workplace\nIf the employee’s death occurs outside of the workplace, employers will still need to notify the Commissioner and submit an incident report, as described above, as long as the death of their employee is work-related.\nSuch scenarios include where:\nAn employee meets with a traffic accident while travelling during work or for work, regardless of the mode of transport. An example would be an employee meeting with a traffic accident while driving his own car or taking the bus to a company meeting.\nAn employee meets with a traffic accident while taking company transport to and fro his or her home and workplace.\nA seaman dies while onboard a Singapore-registered vessel, regardless of the location of the vessel.\nAn employee was injured in a work accident or contracted an occupational disease due to work exposure to biological or chemical agents and subsequently dies from the injury or disease outside the workplace.\nFailure to notify and report an accident or occupational disease leading to an employee’s death is an offence. An employer found guilty of this offence could face a fine of up to $5,000 for the first offence, and a fine of up to $10,000 and/or up to 6 months’ jail for subsequent offences.\nIf you had already submitted an incident report when your employee was injured in a work accident, or at the time he/she contracted an occupational disease, you do not need to submit it again in the unfortunate circumstances that the employee consequently dies. However, you still must notify the Commissioner\nimmediately.\nPayment of Any Monies or Salary Due\nA deceased employee may have accrued salary, and any other sums (such as public holiday pay), before his or her death. Employers should settle all outstanding employment issues, including the payment of any monies owed or salary due to the deceased employee.\nThe amount to be paid to your employee will depend on the employment contract signed between you and your employee. For employees who receive monthly payments, the amount should be calculated based on the number of days your employee had worked in that month until his death.\nThe salary can be paid into the deceased employee’s bank account. However, once the bank is notified of the deceased’s death, there will be an immediate “freeze” of the deceased employee’s bank account(s). In such circumstances, and if possible, you may want to contact the next-of-kin or the deceased’s personal representative on how to proceed with the payment of salary and other monies due.\nThe deceased’s personal representative is the person who is authorised to manage the deceased’s estate, whether via a Grant of Probate or Grant of Letters of\nAdministration.\nPayment of Maternity Benefits Where a Female Employee Dies During Maternity Leave\nEvery female employee on\nmaternity leave\nis entitled to receive a form of payment, known as a maternity benefit, from her employer at her gross rate of pay.\nUnder\nsection 79 of the Employment Act\n, if a female employee is on maternity leave and dies from any cause\nbefore\nconfinement, her employer must pay her maternity benefit to the person nominated by her to receive such benefit, or her personal representative if there is no one nominated.\nThe amount of the maternity benefit payable is capped at 30 days’ worth of gross rate of pay, unless the duration of time from the employee’s last day of work to the day right before her death exceeds 30 days.\nIf the female employee dies\non or after the day\nof confinement and before any maternity benefit has been paid to her, the amount of maternity benefit to be paid is calculated from her last day of work up to the day before the day of her death, subtracting any maternity benefit that has already been paid to her. The payment must likewise be made to the female employee’s nominated person or her personal\nrepresentative.\nPayment of Compensation\nEmployers, or their insurers, may be required to\npay work injury compensation\nfor the employee’s death under the Workplace Injury Compensation Act (WICA).\nCompensation is limited to the disease, or injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment, that caused the employee’s death. This would include instances of death caused by meeting with an accident in a foreign country that the employee had been assigned to work in, and meeting with an accident while travelling to the workplace in a vehicle operated by or on behalf of the employer.\nCompensation for the employee’s death is payable to the deceased employee’s estate or to the benefit of his dependants (i.e. family members).\nIn addition, the WICA is a no-fault compensation scheme. This means that if the WICA claim by the employee’s dependants is successful, employers must make such work injury compensation regardless of whether they were at fault for the injury causing the employee’s death.\nThe employee’s dependants may claim a lump-sum compensation, with the amount\ncalculated\nfrom the employee’s average monthly earnings multiplied by an age multiplying factor.\nThe following compensation limits should also be noted:\nAccidents before 1 January 2020\nAccidents from 1 January 2020\nMinimum compensation\n$69,000\n$76,000\nMaximum compensation\n$204,000\n$225,000\nWhen is an employer not required to pay compensation under WICA?\nEmployers are not liable to pay compensation under WICA if the employee met with an accident leading to his death that was not workplace-related. Employers are also not liable to pay for compensation under WICA for domestic workers, independent contractors and uniformed personnel of the government.\nAdditionally, employers need not pay compensation under WICA if employees die after they:\nInjure themselves on purpose;\nDeliberately make an existing injury more serious; or\nInjure themselves when under the influence of alcohol or a prescription drug\nnot prescribed by a doctor.\nReturning of Employee’s Belongings at the Workplace to His/Her Family\nEmployers should arrange for the employee’s personal belongings at the workplace to be packed and delivered to the family, depending on how the family wishes for their loved one’s belongings to be\nhandled.\nWhat to Do If the Deceased Employee is a Foreigner\nInforming MOM and employee’s family of the death\nIf your foreign employee is a Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW), you are required to contact the police immediately upon her death. You also have to send your name, contact number, and your foreign worker’s name and Work Permit number to MOM\nvia this feedback form\nwithin 12 hours of knowing about the death.\nYou should also contact the employee’s family to inform them of the death as soon as practicable so that arrangements can be made. Such arrangements include paying any outstanding salaries or payments to the worker’s next-of-kin or your employee’s appointed trustee if he or she has one. There will be a section below on handling the employee’s body and belongings.\nRequesting to cancel work passes and permits\nThe Employment Pass (EP), S Pass or Work Permit of the deceased foreign employee must be cancelled within\n1 week\nafter the death of the employee, or\n1 day\nafter the applicable work pass or work permit expires, depending on which comes first.\nEither the employer or appointed employment agent can cancel the work pass or work permit. Employers must also return the cancelled work permit card within 1 week from cancellation by post.\nShould employers be unable to return the card, such as where the card is missing or damaged beyond repair, they can use the\nWP Online’s\n“card return” function to explain why they are unable to return the card.\nNote\n: Cancelling the main work pass will also cancel the Dependant’s Pass (DP), which will have implications on DP holders. You may refer to the section below for more information.\nRequesting to cancel work permits for FDWs\nEmployers of deceased FDWs are required to cancel their work permit immediately after informing MOM of the death. This may be done through the\nFDW eService\n.\nIf the employer does not have a valid SingPass to access the FDW eService, he or she can submit to MOM a\nrequest to cancel the work permit\nof the deceased helper. An authorised person can also submit the request on behalf of the employer.\nEmployers will need to upload a copy of the employee’s death certificate, as well as the airway bill, burial certificate or cremation certification where applicable. MOM will cancel the work permit within 3 working days of receiving the request.\nEmployers may also wish to apply for a domestic helper levy waiver\nhere\nwith a copy of the deceased’s death certificate. Employers can apply for it only after the levy has been charged and the application must be made within 1 year of the levy bill.\nBearing of costs in the handling of employee’s body and belongings\nDepending on what the foreign employee’s family decides, employers have to\nbear the cost\nof either:\nHaving the body buried in Singapore;\nCremating the body in Singapore and returning the ashes to the employee’s home country; or\nReturning the body to the employee’s home country.\nEmployers will also have to bear the cost of returning the foreign employee’s belongings to the family, as well as pay the family any outstanding salaries or monies due to the foreign employee.\nIf the employee’s family are on Dependant’s Passes in Singapore, does the employer need to pay for their repatriation?\nAs DP holders no longer have valid passes once the main work pass has been cancelled, they will need to leave Singapore. Employers are required to buy air tickets to send the DP holders to the international airport in their home country nearest to their hometown. This is unless a DP holder agrees in writing to bear the cost.\nEmployers can also\nrequest for a Short Term Visit Pass\n(STVP) to allow their employee’s family members who are DP holders to stay in Singapore for up to 30 days to settle their affairs. Once the pass expires, the family members must leave Singapore.\n—\nThe death of an employee is an unfortunate situation which may leave you feeling distressed and at a loss for what to do next. Once you are aware of your employee’s death and the circumstances surrounding the death, you can then proceed with the necessary steps.\nFor workplace-related deaths, you should immediately notify the Commissioner, or the police in the case of FDWs. You should also submit an incident report to MOM, as well as inform your insurer about the death.\nThereafter, other actions may be appropriate: calling the employee’s next-of-kin to settle matters such as payment of compensation, any monies or salary due or maternity benefits, as well as the return of your employee’s belongings.\nFor foreign employees, their Work Passes need to be cancelled. You are required to bear the costs of handling the employee’s body and belongings, as well as the repatriation of the employee’s family if they are living in Singapore.\nWe hope that this article has helped you in understanding the steps you should take in dealing with the death of an employee.

{"chunk_id": "SLA_cd8a6a5a", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "Are Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employment Contracts > Are Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?", "text": "Are Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nLast updated on March 20, 2025\nCodes of conduct are typically found in workplace settings across all industries, with the purpose of outlining how every staff member is expected to interact with others and operate at work by establishing norms and expectations.\nWhile codes of conduct are not a panacea to all issues in the workplace, the value add of such codes is that those who understand their expected behaviour, may be more effective in their positions as they feel more at ease at work and work harmoniously with each other. Outlining company guidelines and rules may also serve as a communication tool to stakeholders about its values and commitment to them.\nIn this article, we will cover:\nWhat is a Code of Conduct?\nWhile not all codes of conduct are the same (some are more liberal than others in their enforcement, focusing on education and community-building rather than punishment and exclusion), the key denominator across codes of conduct is that they are generally standards that lay out the expectations of ethical behaviour and its adherence to their stipulated standard.\nA good code of conduct utilises clear and concise language, covers a comprehensive range of issues, is flexible enough (not too prescriptive; can be contextually adapted), ensures accountability of employees, and is regularly updated. When written well, a code of conduct can be motivational and inspiring for employees to perform well in the workplace, instead of fear-mongering and serving as a negative piece of policy.\nExamples of well-written code of conduct clauses include Sport Singapore’s inclusion of key ethical standards and integrity in their actions:\n“Exercise self-awareness and evaluate how your values and actions influence your coaching activities positively or negatively.”\n“Uphold the values of clean, dope-free sport, by complying with all relevant anti-doping rules… Be a positive influence to those under your charge with respect to the values of clean sport.”\nOn the other hand, code of conduct clauses that may be fear-mongering include clauses worded similarly to “Employees who violate company policies will be subject to immediate termination.”\nWhat is Typically Included in a Code of Conduct?\nThe scope of a code of conduct depends on the needs and requirements of the specific organisation. Some professions require more stringent codes of conduct (e.g., legal, banking/ finance, medical), and would therefore have both a wider, and more in-depth coverage within its code, along with a more comprehensive and rigorous conduct investigation and rule enforcement if so.\nThey typically cover issues such as employee values (e.g., honesty, integrity, respect), confidentiality requirements, compliance with relevant rules and regulations, and the avoidance of conflicts of interests, with the end goal of creating a culture of ethical behaviour which upholds a high standard of morality. Such coverage helps lay out workplace norms from workplace bullying or harassment/poor conduct, to issues of gift receiving and giving.\nThe following are examples of what codes of conduct may include:\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore lays out 4 key guiding principles:\nPersonal and professional behaviour\n“… highest standards of conduct and behaviour in and outside MAS to safeguard MAS’ reputation and interests…”\nDuty of confidentiality\n“… during the course of our employment with MAS and even after we leave MAS.”\nConflicts of interest\n“… avoid situations that may give rise to actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest…”\nUse of MAS’ resources\n“…in a responsible and appropriate manner.”\nThe Singapore Retailers Association lays out 4 main sections:\nPart A – Conduct and Spirit of Negotiations\n“… must adopt a consensual approach to negotiate in good faith, which includes acting honestly and fairly…”\nPart B – Leasing Principles for Key Tenancy Terms\n11 key tenancy terms within\nPart C – Data Transparency\n“…must share sales data metrics by…”\nPart D – Dispute Resolution & Enforcement\n“For non-compliant practices, parties can report these cases to the FITC…”\nCan I Include/Enforce a Code of Conduct Within a Contract?\nYes, you can, if it is stated that its adherence is a requirement for parties who choose to enter into the contract. However, the contract itself must be legally valid before a code of conduct can be enforced.\nIs a Code of Conduct Legally Binding?\nA Code of conduct is typically a form of good corporate governance practice and self-regulation. It is not strictly legally binding unless the company decides to specifically put it within a legal instrument as a material clause (e.g., within the employment contract or within the employee handbook). This means that adherence to the code is legally binding and any subsequent violation could amount to a breach of contract. The employer/company can then take legal action against the employee for the breach.\nFor example, in a 2023 case, a company sued its employee for quitting after receiving his bonus. A clause in that company’s “Employee Handbook” provided that employees were not eligible for bonuses if they were serving their notice period on the date/month when such bonuses were paid out. The employee claimed that he was unaware of the clause as it was not stated in his employment contract, but the company referred to a clause in the employment contract which, among others, proavided that employment benefits were subject to terms laid down in the Employee Handbook.

Outlining company guidelines and rules may also serve as a communication tool to stakeholders about its values and commitment to them.\nIn this article, we will cover:\nWhat is a Code of Conduct?\nWhile not all codes of conduct are the same (some are more liberal than others in their enforcement, focusing on education and community-building rather than punishment and exclusion), the key denominator across codes of conduct is that they are generally standards that lay out the expectations of ethical behaviour and its adherence to their stipulated standard.\nA good code of conduct utilises clear and concise language, covers a comprehensive range of issues, is flexible enough (not too prescriptive; can be contextually adapted), ensures accountability of employees, and is regularly updated. When written well, a code of conduct can be motivational and inspiring for employees to perform well in the workplace, instead of fear-mongering and serving as a negative piece of policy.\nExamples of well-written code of conduct clauses include Sport Singapore’s inclusion of key ethical standards and integrity in their actions:\n“Exercise self-awareness and evaluate how your values and actions influence your coaching activities positively or negatively.”\n“Uphold the values of clean, dope-free sport, by complying with all relevant anti-doping rules… Be a positive influence to those under your charge with respect to the values of clean sport.”\nOn the other hand, code of conduct clauses that may be fear-mongering include clauses worded similarly to “Employees who violate company policies will be subject to immediate termination.”\nWhat is Typically Included in a Code of Conduct?\nThe scope of a code of conduct depends on the needs and requirements of the specific organisation. Some professions require more stringent codes of conduct (e.g., legal, banking/ finance, medical), and would therefore have both a wider, and more in-depth coverage within its code, along with a more comprehensive and rigorous conduct investigation and rule enforcement if so.\nThey typically cover issues such as employee values (e.g., honesty, integrity, respect), confidentiality requirements, compliance with relevant rules and regulations, and the avoidance of conflicts of interests, with the end goal of creating a culture of ethical behaviour which upholds a high standard of morality. Such coverage helps lay out workplace norms from workplace bullying or harassment/poor conduct, to issues of gift receiving and giving.\nThe following are examples of what codes of conduct may include:\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore lays out 4 key guiding principles:\nPersonal and professional behaviour\n“… highest standards of conduct and behaviour in and outside MAS to safeguard MAS’ reputation and interests…”\nDuty of confidentiality\n“… during the course of our employment with MAS and even after we leave MAS.”\nConflicts of interest\n“… avoid situations that may give rise to actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest…”\nUse of MAS’ resources\n“…in a responsible and appropriate manner.”\nThe Singapore Retailers Association lays out 4 main sections:\nPart A – Conduct and Spirit of Negotiations\n“… must adopt a consensual approach to negotiate in good faith, which includes acting honestly and fairly…”\nPart B – Leasing Principles for Key Tenancy Terms\n11 key tenancy terms within\nPart C – Data Transparency\n“…must share sales data metrics by…”\nPart D – Dispute Resolution & Enforcement\n“For non-compliant practices, parties can report these cases to the FITC…”\nCan I Include/Enforce a Code of Conduct Within a Contract?\nYes, you can, if it is stated that its adherence is a requirement for parties who choose to enter into the contract. However, the contract itself must be legally valid before a code of conduct can be enforced.\nIs a Code of Conduct Legally Binding?\nA Code of conduct is typically a form of good corporate governance practice and self-regulation. It is not strictly legally binding unless the company decides to specifically put it within a legal instrument as a material clause (e.g., within the employment contract or within the employee handbook). This means that adherence to the code is legally binding and any subsequent violation could amount to a breach of contract. The employer/company can then take legal action against the employee for the breach.\nFor example, in a 2023 case, a company sued its employee for quitting after receiving his bonus. A clause in that company’s “Employee Handbook” provided that employees were not eligible for bonuses if they were serving their notice period on the date/month when such bonuses were paid out. The employee claimed that he was unaware of the clause as it was not stated in his employment contract, but the company referred to a clause in the employment contract which, among others, proavided that employment benefits were subject to terms laid down in the Employee Handbook. The district judge held that in this case, the employee handbook was part of the employment contract.\nYou may wish to read our other article on\nbreach of contract\nfor more information.\nOn the other hand, any violation of a non-legally binding code could render the employee subject to internal disciplinary processes and the potential consequences would depend on the company’s internal governance processes.\nThere may also be situations where the code of conduct comprises a clause that can result in both internal and\nexternal\ndisciplinary action. This can include situations of\nemployee misconduct\nthat result in the employee’s failure to fulfil the conditions of employment in the contract of service\n. For example, if a company includes an anti-harassment policy in its code of conduct, and an employee subsequently commits workplace harassment, the employee could be dismissed in addition to potentially facing criminal liability under the\nProtection from Harassment Act\nand/or penalties from other relevant bodies.\nDo note that according to the\nMOM’s website\n, if an employee is accused of misconduct, it is the employer’s duty to inform the employee of their alleged misconduct and that they will be conducting an inquiry (no fixed procedure) which should take no more than a week to complete.

Non-compliance may be considered a breach of contract. Both employers and employees should pay close attention to these codes and especially the specific nuances within.\nIf you require further advice on the legal implications and/or enforcement of certain codes, you should\nconsult an employment lawyer\nto assist in helping you gain clarity in the matter.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

{"chunk_id": "SLA_35334df0", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "Morality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employment Contracts > Morality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?", "text": "Morality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nLast updated on August 17, 2025\nWhat is a Morality Clause?\nA morality clause is a contractual provision that typically excuses one party from performance of the contract in the event that the other party does something in their private life that might be considered immoral.\nMorality clauses are typically drafted broadly and vaguely, and can provide the more powerful party in a contractual relationship with a way to escape the contract where their association with the counterparty might damage their reputation.\nMorality clauses are extremely common in\nemployment agreements\nand also in contracts in the sports and entertainment industry, such as sponsorship agreements. Typically, the consequence of breaching such a clause is termination of the contract.\nThis article will explain:\nIs It Legal to Include a Morality Clause in Contracts in Singapore?\nIn Singapore, there is no law that prohibits the use of morality clauses in contracts. They are not inherently\nunfair contract terms\n. However, for a contract term to be valid and enforceable in Singapore, it needs to be specific enough for both parties to know what it meant before they entered into the contract.\nGiven the typically vague drafting employed for morality clauses, this presents the most obvious basis on which to attack the validity of a specific morality clause.\nWhat May Constitute a Breach of a Morality Clause?\nIt is easy to allege that a person is in breach of a morality clause. However, morality is notoriously subjective, meaning that what is immoral to one person may be perfectly acceptable to another. It is therefore difficult to predict what a judge may think amounts to a breach of a morality clause.\nA broadly drafted morality clause may be regarded as either:\nBroad enough to encompass any kind of conduct that might conceivably be perceived by someone as objectionable; or\nOverbroad, such that it lacks sufficient specificity to facilitate compliance with it.\nMorality clauses typically prohibit the individual from doing anything that might reflect negatively on the counterparty by association with the individual. Arguably, this could include everything from genocide to even failing to hold open a door for someone. Whether any specific instance of alleged breach is sufficient to trigger an enforceable morality clause is something that can be tested only in court.\nThere is very little guidance from Singapore precedents on what is sufficient in this regard. However, a case from the Ontario Court of Appeals found that the leaking of a sportsman’s nude photographs was insufficient grounds to trigger cancellation of a sponsorship agreement pursuant to its morality clause.\nThis was because the sportsman had shared the photographs with his partner, and had not intended to share the photographs publicly. Furthermore, the photographs were taken before the agreement was signed, and the court found that the morality clause did not cover prior conduct.\nSeparately, the clause in that case prohibited conduct that:\n“shocks, insults, or offends the community, or which has the effect of ridiculing public morals and decency”.\nThis language was ultimately found to be too vague to cover a case of an individual’s nude photographs being leaked without his consent. However, that is not to say that more precise drafting of the clause could not have effectively included this conduct in its scope.\nThat said, such precise drafting could also cause concern to\nvictims of revenge porn\n, who might lose their jobs through no fault of their own if their nude photographs are leaked without their consent. It is difficult to predict how a Singaporean court might react to such a case, but given the generally conservative nature of Singaporean society, what may be unobjectionable in Ontario may well offend community sensibilities in Singapore, or at least the sensibilities of the average judge in Singapore’s courts. Parties being asked to sign contracts containing morality clauses should therefore approach them with caution.\nWhat Can I Do If I Feel that a Morality Clause has been Unfairly Drafted?\nIn employment contracts\nIf you are presented with an employment contract containing a morality clause that you feel is unfairly drafted, negotiating it is a very delicate proposition that the potential employer may view with alarm. This is because your employer may assume the source of your reluctance to agree to the morality clause to be a desire to engage in precisely the kind of “immoral” behaviour that the clause anticipates.\nOften, even the most diplomatically couched objections by a job applicant to overbroad drafting language, and the nuances of vague contractual provisions that shift liability from the employer to the employee, may be lost on the average Singaporean human resources executive who just wants your signature on an unmodified contract. As a result, they may perceive any concerns about specific legal terms as an incompatibility with the employer’s values and might conceivably recommend that the employer withdraw the offer.\nAs a result, morality clauses, no matter how vaguely drafted, are usually just too prickly an issue to discuss in a sensible employment contract negotiation, and end up in the contract in whatever form the employer chose.\nIn any case, their practical impact is somewhat limited in the Singapore context, where most employment relationships are merely employment at will that an employer can\nterminate\nwithout providing a reason for termination by giving a short amount of notice. The only impact a morality clause can have in such a scenario is to terminate an employment contract immediately, causing usually relatively insubstantial financial damage to an employee in the amount of a few weeks’ salary.\nIn sports and entertainment contracts\nConversely, in the sports and entertainment industry, contracts are typically negotiated by lawyers on both sides. As a result, the public figure sometimes has more bargaining power than a prospective employee in the above employment contract situation, and there can be some scope to improve the drafting of a morality clause.\nIf both sides have reasonable lawyers, it is sometimes possible to address both parties’ concerns and ensure the negotiation of a valid, enforceable and fair morality clause that provides a reasonable degree of predictability in its scope.\nHowever, it is seldom possible to negotiate the removal of a morality clause altogether. This is because a brand associating itself with a personality will quite reasonably want to minimise risk to its reputation in the event that the personality damages his/her own reputation. After all, the entire purpose of such a contract is usually to enhance a brand’s reputation by associating it with an individual who already enjoys a good reputation and commands a high level of public recognition.\n—\nIn summary, morality clauses are risky for those upon whom they are imposed and difficult to negotiate with a view to reducing an individual’s liability. They are also not inherently unreasonable and are a sensible risk management mechanism for employers, sponsors and so on. However, careful attention needs to be devoted to drafting them, with sufficient specificity to facilitate a mutual understanding between parties of what they actually require, before the contract is signed.\nIf you are entering into some kind of public relations/sponsorship contract in Singapore, you should\nengage a lawyer\nto negotiate its terms, including the morality clause, for you. If you are entering into an employment agreement, understand the risks posed by the morality clause in your contract and plan accordingly.\nFinally, if you believe that your employment has been unfairly terminated on the basis of a morality clause,\nseek legal advice\nto understand whether you may have a basis for redress and what kind of damages you could expect in the event of a successful legal suit.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

If you are entering into an employment agreement, understand the risks posed by the morality clause in your contract and plan accordingly.\nFinally, if you believe that your employment has been unfairly terminated on the basis of a morality clause,\nseek legal advice\nto understand whether you may have a basis for redress and what kind of damages you could expect in the event of a successful legal suit.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Upon entering into employment contracts, we might sometimes enter into employment bonds.\nAn employment bond can be created in a few instances. One example could be where the employer pays for the training of the employee – the employee would then be considered to be ‘bonded’ to the company for a number of years. If the employee chooses to terminate their employment before the agreed-upon period, the employee would be liable to pay a sum of money to the company.\nMore crucially, an employment bond is different from a liquidated damages clause. A liquidated damages clause is a clause that provides for a sum of compensation if a term of the employment contract is breached. On the other hand, an employment bond is inclusive of all the terms and conditions found in a standard employment contract, including a liquidated damages clause. Hence, the focus of this article is on the bond agreement that exists between the employee and the employer, and not a liquidated damages clause.\nThis article will provide an overview of employment bonds in Singapore with examples of situations when such bonds may be enforceable. In particular, it will cover:\nWhat is an Employment Bond?\nAn employment bond is an agreement entered into by an employer with an employee. This agreement would state that the employee is required to remain with the company for a minimum period of time after joining the company, and in scenarios where they are sent for training.\nUsually, the employer and the employee would further agree that if the employee leaves before the agreed-upon time, the employee will have to compensate the employer a certain amount of money.\nWhat is the purpose of an employment bond?\nAn employer might draw up an employment bond agreement because, at first glance, an employment bond appears to be reasonable, fair and advantageous for the employer. In other words, an employment bond is an employer-centric tool. It functions as a way of investing in the employee’s learning and development, where the bond requires an employee to remain with the company in return for training received. This ultimately benefits the company because an employee would be better placed to perform well and succeed in their job having undergone the relevant training.\nHowever, when an employee enters into a bond agreement, it creates an obligation on the part of the employee where they can be liable for a sum of money to replace the employer’s expenses for the training of the employee.\nIf the amount of money used to replace the employer’s expenses is too much, and the employer foresees that the employee will not be able to pay in the event of a breach, they may require the employee to have a guarantor who will take the financial responsibility if the employee cannot.\nDoes a sign-on bonus create an employment bond?\nA sign-on bonus is a financial incentive that an employer offers to the employee. For instance, an employee who completes an initial contract of 1 year, and agrees to sign on as a permanent employee, will receive a sign-on bonus. It is usually a one-time payment, which means that it is not included in your overall compensation plan.\nEmployers may offer a sign-on bonus to encourage an employee to join their company. For example, if a candidate is planning to leave their current employer before receiving their annual bonus, offering a sign-on bonus during salary and onboarding negotiations can serve as a pull factor to stay in the company. Further, a sign-on bonus could also serve to counter a lower salary or benefits package that may not initially match the candidate’s expectations.\nA sign-on bonus creates an employment bond because there is usually a minimum time period that an employee has to fulfil before being awarded the bonus. This creates a contractual obligation on the part of the employee to either fulfil the minimum time period until it is completed, or pay a penalty.\nIn addition, to prevent an employee from leaving soon after they receive their sign-on bonuses, employers would usually add a clause in the employment contract whereby the employee agrees to refund the sign-on bonus amount (partially or pro rata) if they leave the company before the contractually-agreed upon time period.\nAre Employment Bonds Enforceable in Singapore?\nThe starting point on whether employment bonds are enforceable can be found in the UK case of\nDunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company v New Garage and Motor (“Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company”).\nIn\nDunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company,\nthe courts decided that an employment bond is enforceable if the contract includes a clause on the payment of liquidated damages, and the amount of damages is an\nhonest pre-estimate\nof the loss stemming from the early termination or breach of the contract.\nOn the contrary, a provision will be deemed as a ‘penalty’ and unenforceable if the damages or obligation sought is\nexcessive when\ncompared to the losses that could possibly be proven to stem from the breach of contract.\nThe Singapore case of\nXia Zhengyan v Geng Changqing\n, agreed with the approach used in\nDunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company.\nThe UK Supreme Court further expanded this traditional test in the 2015 case of\nCavendish Square Holdings v El-Makdessi\n(“\nCavendish”\n). In\nCavendish,\nthe test laid out by the courts is as follows:\nWhat legitimate interest does the clause protect?\nLegitimate interest refers to either the interests or rights that are created by the clause. In this context, the right that is created by an employment bond is the employer’s right to ensure that money spent training the employee is not wasted. This could occur if the employee leaves right after receiving training, without completing the bond.\nIs there a secondary obligation created by the clause?\nAs a matter of contract law, a contract creates primary and secondary obligations. In the case of employment bonds, a primary obligation would be to ensure the fulfilment of the bond period on the part of the employee. Consequently, a secondary obligation would be the obligation to pay a sum of money following a breach of contract.\nIs it the employer’s legitimate interest to impose such a secondary obligation?\nAs mentioned above, the question is whether it is valid for the employer to impose a sum of money on the employee following a breach of contract. It could be valid because the penalty is paid to replace the amount of money that was expended on the employee for training.\nIs the secondary obligation of the contract-breaker to protect that interest considered proportional to the legitimate interest of the innocent party?\nThis part of the test is to understand if the secondary obligation imposed is proportionate and valid in relation to the penalties paid by the innocent party.\nThe answer to the questions in the\nCavendish\ntest laid out above would determine if the employment bond contains a clause that amounts to a penalty. Even if the amount is not a genuine pre-estimate of loss as stated by the employer, it does not mean that the specific clause detailing the amount is automatically qualified as a penalty clause. In fact, the\nCavendish\ntest is more employee-centric in that it is broader and takes into account the legitimate interests of the employee.\nFollowing the\nCavendish\ntest, an example where a bond might be unenforceable is when the bond is deemed to be unreasonable or one-sided, e.g., if the penalty amount is disproportionate to or twice the amount invested in training the employee.\nI have Signed an Employment Bond with My Employer. If I Want to ‘Break’ the Employment Bond, What Defences Can I Invoke?\nWhen an employee enters an employment contract, all standard contractual obligations would apply and should be followed. A standard contractual obligation could be fulfilling the job scope under the contract, or the fulfilment of a minimum time period before they can quit their job. These contractual obligations are then breached if the employee decides to break the bond, allowing the employer to have a claim against the employee for breach of contract.\nSince all standard rules of contract apply and should be followed, normal defences such as duress and misrepresentation would apply when a claim for breach of contract exists:\nDuress and unconscionability\nDuress can be used as a defence when the employee is able to prove that they signed the contract while being coerced or forced. For example, where there are physical threats of harm or where the employee’s movable personal property, such as personal items like a mobile phone or wallet, was being wrongfully withheld by the employer. Such circumstances may\nconstitute a successful defence against an employment bond claim.\nAnother situation in which an employee may succeed in their defence against enforcing an employment bond would be in the case of unconscionability. This is a case where the employer had far more bargaining power than the employee. As such, the employee signs the bond without understanding the full extent of their obligations under the bond, and was induced by the employer to sign an unconscionable contract. In this case, the court might declare the contract to be invalid.\nMisrepresentation\nIf the promised training, upgrading and upskilling never happened, this would constitute misrepresentation of the employment bond contract. The employee cannot be expected to honour the employment bond.\nNevertheless, please understand that even if the various defences are set out above, the applicability of these defences is ultimately fact-dependent on each individual’s case and the specificities of the contract. It is therefore important to\nseek legal advice from an employment lawyer\nin this regard, as there are no guarantees that your case might succeed by raising these defences.\n—\nIf you have signed an employment bond or wish to clarify if your employment contract includes such a bond, it is recommended that you\nseek legal advice from a lawyer who specialises in Singapore employment disputes\n.\nAn employment disputes lawyer can provide you with an assessment of the likelihood that the employment bond is enforceable against you, and therefore assist you in making an informed choice on whether you should terminate your bond early.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

What is the difference between the two types of contracts? Does it even matter?\nThis article aims to explain some of the key differences between contracts of service and contracts for service, and help you understand why it is important for you to be aware of these differences.\nThis will ensure that your legal rights are adequately protected when signing such contracts in future.\nWhat is the Difference between a Contract of Service and a Contract for Service?\nWhat is a contract\nof\nservice?\nA contract of service (also known as an\nemployment agreement\n) is an agreement where one person (Party A) agrees to employ another (Party B) as an employee with a company or organisation. A contract of service establishes an employer-employee relationship between Party A and Party B.\nA contract of service is usually in the form of a letter of appointment or employment, which sets out\nkey employment terms\nthat Party B, as the employee, should be aware of. Some of these key terms include:\nThe full names of the employer and employee;\nThe job title, main duties and responsibilities;\nThe start date and duration of employment;\nWorking hours and leave benefits; and\nSalary and allowances.\nEmployees under a contract of service may also be\ncovered by the Employment Act\n, which provides for the basic terms and conditions at work for employees covered by the Act.\nWhat is a contract\nfor\nservice?\nA contract for service (also known as a\nfreelance service contract\n) is an agreement between an organisation and an independent contractor who is engaged to carry out a particular assignment or project for a defined fee. Such an independent contractor could be a self-employed person or vendor.\nA contract for service establishes a client-contractor relationship between the contracting parties. The independent contractor carries out business on his or her own account, unlike in a contract of service where the employee does business for the employer.\nIndependent contractors are not covered by the Employment Act, and statutory benefits such as working hours and leave benefits do not apply to them.

This legal relationship means that an\nemployer is obliged to provide work\nfor an employee, and the\nemployee is obliged to complete the work\n.\nA contract of service is also usually in the form of a\nwritten agreement\nthat clearly sets out the obligations owed by the employer and employee in this legal relationship.\nDo note that a contract of service only comes into effect when the employee turns up for work on the appointed start date, as stipulated in the agreed terms of the contract.

What is the difference between the two types of contracts? Does it even matter?\nThis article aims to explain some of the key differences between contracts of service and contracts for service, and help you understand why it is important for you to be aware of these differences.\nThis will ensure that your legal rights are adequately protected when signing such contracts in future.\nWhat is the Difference between a Contract of Service and a Contract for Service?\nWhat is a contract\nof\nservice?\nA contract of service (also known as an\nemployment agreement\n) is an agreement where one person (Party A) agrees to employ another (Party B) as an employee with a company or organisation. A contract of service establishes an employer-employee relationship between Party A and Party B.\nA contract of service is usually in the form of a letter of appointment or employment, which sets out\nkey employment terms\nthat Party B, as the employee, should be aware of. Some of these key terms include:\nThe full names of the employer and employee;\nThe job title, main duties and responsibilities;\nThe start date and duration of employment;\nWorking hours and leave benefits; and\nSalary and allowances.\nEmployees under a contract of service may also be\ncovered by the Employment Act\n, which provides for the basic terms and conditions at work for employees covered by the Act.\nWhat is a contract\nfor\nservice?\nA contract for service (also known as a\nfreelance service contract\n) is an agreement between an organisation and an independent contractor who is engaged to carry out a particular assignment or project for a defined fee. Such an independent contractor could be a self-employed person or vendor.\nA contract for service establishes a client-contractor relationship between the contracting parties. The independent contractor carries out business on his or her own account, unlike in a contract of service where the employee does business for the employer.\nIndependent contractors are not covered by the Employment Act, and statutory benefits such as working hours and leave benefits do not apply to them. Contracts for service are also sometimes referred to as freelance service agreements.\nHow Can You Tell What Kind of Contract You are Under?\nThere is no determinative or conclusive test to distinguish a contract of service from a contract for service.\nAs a guide, Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower has compiled a non-exhaustive list of factors that can be considered in identifying which type of contract applies to you:\nControl\nWho decides on the recruitment and dismissal of employees?\nWho pays for employees’ wages and how are they paid?\nWho determines the production process, timing, and method of production?\nWho is responsible for the provision of work?\nOwnership of factors of production\nWho provides the required tools and equipment?\nWho provides the working place and materials?\nEconomic considerations\nIs the business carried out on the person’s own account, or is it for the employer?\nCan the person share in profit or be liable to any risk of loss?\nHow are earnings calculated and profits derived?\nFor example, if it is the employer who is responsible for the provision of work and determines how much and when you should be paid, then you are more likely to be under a contract\nof\nservice.\nOn the other hand, if you are responsible for the provision of work and determine how much to charge for your services, then you are more likely to be under a contract\nfor\nservice instead.\nWhy is it Important to Know the Differences between These Two Types of Contracts?\nIt is important to know what type of contract is applicable to you, because they carry differences in rights, duties, and obligations between you and the contracting counter-party.\nContracts\nof\nservice\nA contract of service establishes a legal relationship between the parties i.e. the employer and employee.

Restraint of trade clauses restrict the liberty of the employee to carry on trade with parties in the future.\nAnother example of a restraint of trade clause is the\nnon-solicitation clause\n, which prevents a former employee from soliciting clients or employees away from the prior employer.\nAre Non-Compete Clauses Legally Enforceable in Singapore?\nSingapore employers are generally entitled to restrain their employees from moonlighting, or doing other jobs while working for them.\nHowever, non-compete clauses that apply after the termination of the employment contract are enforceable in Singapore only if:\nThe non-compete clause protects a\n“legitimate proprietary interest”\nof the employer, and\nThe scope of the non-compete clause is\nreasonable\n.\nThese issues on the enforceability of non-compete clauses in Singapore are summarised in the following infographic. You may click on the infographic to download it in a new tab.\n1. What can be a legitimate proprietary interest?\nFor a non-compete clause to be legally enforceable, it has to be protecting a proprietary interest of the employer that is legitimate.\nSuch proprietary interests can be an\nadvantage\nor\nasset\nwhich can be regarded as the employer’s property, and it would be unjust to allow the former employee to appropriate this for his own purposes. However, this advantage or asset should not be the skill or know-how that the employee acquires as part of his job during his employment.\nAn employer can have a legitimate proprietary interest in:\nTrade secret protection – Restraining an employee from misusing any trade secrets (i.e. confidential information).\nClient and trade connections – Protecting the special trade connections established by the employee with the employer’s customers.\nWorkforce stability – Maintaining a stable, trained workforce especially in an industry that is relatively small and specialised which requires the employer to invest significant resources into training its employees.\nHowever, where the protection of confidential information or trade secrets is already addressed by another contractual clause, the employer will have to demonstrate that the non-compete clause in question covers a legitimate proprietary interest that is more than just protection of confidential information or trade secrets.\nClauses that do not protect a legitimate proprietary interest, but instead seek to illegitimately restrain competition, may not be enforceable in court.\n2. Is the scope of the non-compete clause reasonable?\nVarious factors can affect the reasonableness of the scope of a non-compete clause. For each factor, the reasonableness of the clause will be determined based on whether it is reasonable:\nAs between the parties themselves\n; and\nIn the interests of the public\n(e.g. securing an environment in which freedom of trade and competition can flourish).\nExamples of factors that determine the reasonableness of the scope of a non-compete clause include:\n(a) Scope of employees being restrained\nNon-compete clauses that are drafted to cover all employees regardless of their seniority, nature of work or level of access to confidential information may be considered unreasonable.\nThis is because the clause’s indiscriminate application to all employees would suggest that the true purpose of the non-compete clause was for restraining competition, instead of protecting any of the employer’s legitimate interests.\n(b) Scope of activity being restrained\nThe activities being restrained by the non-compete clause must be those that will help the employer protect their legitimate proprietary interest.\nFor example, a clause may be reasonable if it restricts the employee from the specific area of business that they had been involved with,\nOn the other hand, it may not be reasonable for a clause to:\nInclude a “blanket prohibition” preventing the employee from working in the same industry entirely;\nEntirely preventing the employee from working for a rival, regardless of the employee’s scope of work with the new employer; or\nCover activities that entail minimal expertise and are not integral to the company’s operations.\n(c) Duration that the employee is being restrained for\nWhether the duration of restriction is reasonable would depend on factors such as the particular employee’s:\nNature of the work performed\nSeniority level, his skill level\nLevel of influence with clients\nAccess to confidential information\nParticular industry\nThe duration should not have been arbitrarily chosen. It must also\nnot be longer than that needed\nto protect the employer’s interest. For example, one measure is the time needed for a new employee to have a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate their effectiveness to clients.\nRestraining the employee for a longer period of time may also be reasonable if the employer is looking to protect their client connections, and it would take some time for a newcomer to build their own such connections in the employer’s particular industry.\nNon-compete clauses with no fixed duration of operation may be found to be unreasonable.\n(d) Geographical scope of restraint\nThe geographical area(s) which the former employee is being restrained from will also affect the reasonableness of a non-compete clause.\nDepending on the wording of the non-compete clause, it may restrain the former employee from carrying out business:\nIn certain countries\nIn only certain cities in a country (especially very big countries spanning across large geographical areas)\nWithin a certain radius around the employer’s current areas of practice\nHowever, the geographical scope of the non-compete clause should be\nnecessary to protect the employer’s actual and existing business\n. This is as opposed to protecting the possibility of acquiring future business. There generally has to be a geographical limit to where the former employee had actual and significant client contact.\nIn order to be reasonable in the public interest, the geographic restriction on the employee in certain markets also cannot adversely affect competition in those markets.\nNon-compete clauses with no geographical limitations at all (i.e. they apply worldwide) may potentially be unreasonable.\nNot Sure What To Do Next?\nGet a 20-minute phone call with a lawyer for only $59\nArrange a call now\nExamples:\nAdvice on wrongful termination, non-compete clauses etc.\nSelect\nSelect\nNadia Moynihan\nAugust Law Corporation | 11 years experience | English, Malay\nNadia’s practice encompasses Civil and Commercial Litigation, Matrimonial and Syariah Law as well as Criminal Law.

Strike down just the non-enforceable parts of the non-compete clause\nThe court may apply a “blue pencil test” to\n“cancel out”\n(as if using a blue pen) the parts of the non-compete clause that are unreasonable and hence non-enforceable. This is also known as the doctrine of discretionary severance.\nThe court can do this “cancelling” only to the extent that the remaining words in the clause still make grammatical sense and retain their original meaning.\nHowever, the “blue pencil test” cannot be used to fix an unreasonable non-compete clause if there is nothing that can be cancelled out to make the clause reasonable.\nFor example, if a non-compete clause is unreasonable because it does not state how long it is to restrain the employee for, then there is nothing in the clause that can be cancelled out to make the clause’s duration reasonable.\n2. Strike down the entire non-compete clause\nThe court can also strike down the entire non-compete clause from the contract.\nWhat Can an Employer Do if a Former Employee has Breached an Enforceable Non-Compete Clause?\n1. Apply for an injunction\nIf a former employee appears to have breached an enforceable non-compete clause, the employer can apply for an\ninjunction\nto stop the employee from breaching it any further.\n2. Claim for damages\nThe employer can also claim damages (i.e. compensation) for the former employee’s breach of the non-compete clause.\nCase Study: MoneySmart Singapore Pte Ltd v Artem Musienko\nThe defendant, former Head of Technology of the claimant’s Bubblegum division, resigned and joined MoneyHero, a rival of the claimant as Head of Engineering, Insurance. The dispute centred around a non-compete clause that restricted the defendant from engaging with any Southeast Asian business offering financial product comparison services. The restraint period of 3-12 months was drafted in a  “cascading” manner, intending to make the court apply the severance doctrine and enforce the longest permissible restraint period.\nThe claimant argued that their legitimate proprietary interest was in maintaining a stable, trained workforce. However, the court found this claim unfounded as:\nThe Claimant and MoneyHero did not operate in a small and highly consolidated industry unlike a niche one like the marine winch industry.\nThe claimant did not invest significant resources to build the defendant’s skills from scratch, as he already had relevant experience.\nSince a legitimate proprietary interest was not set out, the non-compete clause was unenforceable. However, the court further explained why the clause unreasonable:\nScope of activity – The defendant had no involvement with MoneySmart’s financial product comparison services or platform, and there was no close connection between his role and those services since he only operated Bubblegum Insurance.\nGeographical scope – The defendant’s work and products were only in Singapore, and was not involved with MoneySmart’s other services in Singapore and Hong Kong, or any other Southeast Asian markets. Hence, it was unreasonable to restrict him from anywhere other than Singapore.\nTemporal scope – The cascading restraint period created uncertainty and undue pressure on the defendant, with the shortest period of restraint still being unfair as it gives the claimant multiple bites of the cherry..\nThe clause was struck down entirely as the unreasonable nature of it cannot be saved either by the claimant’s choice of what to enforce or through severance.\n—\nIf you need legal advice on whether a non-compete clause is enforceable, or need assistance with drafting an enforceable non-compete clause, please\nconsult an employment lawyer\n.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Restraint of trade clauses restrict the liberty of the employee to carry on trade with parties in the future.\nAnother example of a restraint of trade clause is the\nnon-solicitation clause\n, which prevents a former employee from soliciting clients or employees away from the prior employer.\nAre Non-Compete Clauses Legally Enforceable in Singapore?\nSingapore employers are generally entitled to restrain their employees from moonlighting, or doing other jobs while working for them.\nHowever, non-compete clauses that apply after the termination of the employment contract are enforceable in Singapore only if:\nThe non-compete clause protects a\n“legitimate proprietary interest”\nof the employer, and\nThe scope of the non-compete clause is\nreasonable\n.\nThese issues on the enforceability of non-compete clauses in Singapore are summarised in the following infographic. You may click on the infographic to download it in a new tab.\n1. What can be a legitimate proprietary interest?\nFor a non-compete clause to be legally enforceable, it has to be protecting a proprietary interest of the employer that is legitimate.\nSuch proprietary interests can be an\nadvantage\nor\nasset\nwhich can be regarded as the employer’s property, and it would be unjust to allow the former employee to appropriate this for his own purposes. However, this advantage or asset should not be the skill or know-how that the employee acquires as part of his job during his employment.\nAn employer can have a legitimate proprietary interest in:\nTrade secret protection – Restraining an employee from misusing any trade secrets (i.e. confidential information).\nClient and trade connections – Protecting the special trade connections established by the employee with the employer’s customers.\nWorkforce stability – Maintaining a stable, trained workforce especially in an industry that is relatively small and specialised which requires the employer to invest significant resources into training its employees.\nHowever, where the protection of confidential information or trade secrets is already addressed by another contractual clause, the employer will have to demonstrate that the non-compete clause in question covers a legitimate proprietary interest that is more than just protection of confidential information or trade secrets.\nClauses that do not protect a legitimate proprietary interest, but instead seek to illegitimately restrain competition, may not be enforceable in court.\n2. Is the scope of the non-compete clause reasonable?\nVarious factors can affect the reasonableness of the scope of a non-compete clause. For each factor, the reasonableness of the clause will be determined based on whether it is reasonable:\nAs between the parties themselves\n; and\nIn the interests of the public\n(e.g. securing an environment in which freedom of trade and competition can flourish).\nExamples of factors that determine the reasonableness of the scope of a non-compete clause include:\n(a) Scope of employees being restrained\nNon-compete clauses that are drafted to cover all employees regardless of their seniority, nature of work or level of access to confidential information may be considered unreasonable.\nThis is because the clause’s indiscriminate application to all employees would suggest that the true purpose of the non-compete clause was for restraining competition, instead of protecting any of the employer’s legitimate interests.\n(b) Scope of activity being restrained\nThe activities being restrained by the non-compete clause must be those that will help the employer protect their legitimate proprietary interest.\nFor example, a clause may be reasonable if it restricts the employee from the specific area of business that they had been involved with,\nOn the other hand, it may not be reasonable for a clause to:\nInclude a “blanket prohibition” preventing the employee from working in the same industry entirely;\nEntirely preventing the employee from working for a rival, regardless of the employee’s scope of work with the new employer; or\nCover activities that entail minimal expertise and are not integral to the company’s operations.\n(c) Duration that the employee is being restrained for\nWhether the duration of restriction is reasonable would depend on factors such as the particular employee’s:\nNature of the work performed\nSeniority level, his skill level\nLevel of influence with clients\nAccess to confidential information\nParticular industry\nThe duration should not have been arbitrarily chosen. It must also\nnot be longer than that needed\nto protect the employer’s interest. For example, one measure is the time needed for a new employee to have a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate their effectiveness to clients.\nRestraining the employee for a longer period of time may also be reasonable if the employer is looking to protect their client connections, and it would take some time for a newcomer to build their own such connections in the employer’s particular industry.\nNon-compete clauses with no fixed duration of operation may be found to be unreasonable.\n(d) Geographical scope of restraint\nThe geographical area(s) which the former employee is being restrained from will also affect the reasonableness of a non-compete clause.\nDepending on the wording of the non-compete clause, it may restrain the former employee from carrying out business:\nIn certain countries\nIn only certain cities in a country (especially very big countries spanning across large geographical areas)\nWithin a certain radius around the employer’s current areas of practice\nHowever, the geographical scope of the non-compete clause should be\nnecessary to protect the employer’s actual and existing business\n. This is as opposed to protecting the possibility of acquiring future business. There generally has to be a geographical limit to where the former employee had actual and significant client contact.\nIn order to be reasonable in the public interest, the geographic restriction on the employee in certain markets also cannot adversely affect competition in those markets.\nNon-compete clauses with no geographical limitations at all (i.e. they apply worldwide) may potentially be unreasonable.\nNot Sure What To Do Next?\nGet a 20-minute phone call with a lawyer for only $59\nArrange a call now\nExamples:\nAdvice on wrongful termination, non-compete clauses etc.\nSelect\nSelect\nNadia Moynihan\nAugust Law Corporation | 11 years experience | English, Malay\nNadia’s practice encompasses Civil and Commercial Litigation, Matrimonial and Syariah Law as well as Criminal Law.

Are They Enforceable in Singapore?", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employment Contracts > What are Non-Solicitation Clauses? Are They Enforceable in Singapore?", "text": "What are Non-Solicitation Clauses? Are They Enforceable in Singapore?\nLast updated on May 18, 2024\nFor business owners aiming to protect their business from competitors, non-solicitation clauses may be a useful tool to include in their employees’\nemployment contracts\nto prevent the solicitation of the businesses’ clients, employees or even confidential information.\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?\nA non-solicitation clause is a covenant commonly found in employment contracts which aims to\nprevent former employees of a business from taking away clients or current employees of the business\n(i.e., solicitation).\nHow are non-solicitation clauses different from non-compete clauses?\nNon-solicitation clauses are part of a larger group of clauses known as restraint of trade clauses, which restrict the liberty of employees to carry on trade with parties in the future.\nAnother example of a restraint of trade clause is the\nnon-compete clause\n. However, a non-compete clause is distinct from a non-solicitation clause.\nNon-compete clauses aim to prevent former employees from competing against their former company, usually by prohibiting them from plying their trade or skill or engaging in businesses in certain markets, geographies and even competitor companies for a stipulated period of time.\nThis is unlike non-solicitation clauses, which aim to prevent former employees from soliciting clients or employees of their previous company instead.\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses Used For and When are they Enforceable?\nNon-solicitation clauses may be used for different purposes.\nTo prevent solicitation of employees\nFor one, a non-solicitation clause could be signed by a company and an employee, where the company seeks to prevent such former employees from soliciting current employees away from the business.\nSuch a clause is only enforceable where it is:\nAimed at protecting the legitimate proprietary interest of the company; and\nReasonable with reference to the interests of the company, former employee and the public.\nFor example, where the company has a legitimate interest in maintaining a stable and trained workforce, it may be that the clause can only be enforced against senior staff, but not junior staff. This is because the senior staff are likely to have significant influence over former subordinates.\nFor example, the employer’s need for protection may arise where a senior staff member is in a position to manage employees and had established personal relationships with them. This is because the senior staff member may seek to exploit such relationships, and entice the employees to leave the company as well.\nA non-solicitation clause may also be more likely to be reasonable in the interests of the company and the former employee if:\nIt has been extensively negotiated over by both parties (such that they had sufficient say in what the final clause should be provide for); or\nThe former employee is being compensated well in return for accepting the non-solicitation clause.\nTo prevent solicitation of another company’s employees\nInstead of being signed by a company and an employee, a non-solicitation clause could also be signed by two companies which seek to prevent the other business from employing their employees. Such a clause is enforceable only if it is reasonably necessary to fulfil a legitimate business purpose.\nAn example would be when such a clause is necessary during mergers and acquisitions where the companies wish to prevent the movement of employees between the two entities during the implementation of the merger.\nIf there is no legitimate commercial purpose, such a clause may be deemed as a violation of\nsection 34 of the Singapore Competition Act\nwhich prohibits all agreements with the:\n“object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition within Singapore.”\nThis is because the clause may unreasonably affect the companies’ ability to compete in the hiring of new employees from the talent pool.\nAn infringement of this Competition Act prohibition could subject the companies involved to financial penalties and possibly a private action for damages.\nTo protect trade secrets and trade connections\nA non-solicitation clause can also seek to protect confidential information and trade secrets by restricting unauthorised disclosure of such information.\nFor instance, such a clause can seek to prevent former employees from soliciting customers/suppliers who are considered trade connections of a business. Such trade connections have been traditionally recognised as a legitimate proprietary interest.\nHowever, where there is another clause in the employment agreement such as a\nnon-disclosure clause\nwhich also prevents the use or disclosure of confidential information, a non-solicitation clause is unlikely to be enforceable.\nA non-solicitation clause seeking to protect the same information is only enforceable if, the company can demonstrate that the non-solicitation clause covers a legitimate proprietary interest relating to the confidential information, where this interest goes over and beyond the protection already provided by the non-disclosure clause.\nWhat Happens If a Non-Solicitation Clause is Found to be Unenforceable?\nThe parts of a non-solicitation clause that are found to be unreasonable, because they go beyond what is necessary to protect a particular legitimate proprietary interest, will be unenforceable.\nDepending on the situation, the court may either sever just the unenforceable portions of the clause or strike down the entire clause.\n1.

Liquidated damages clauses can pose concerns to employees who wish to quit their job before their employment term is up.\nAdditionally, it can place job-seekers in a dilemma when they have signed an employment contract with Company A, only to receive a more attractive offer from Company B – will they be liable to pay Company A $X if they choose to break their contract before their first day of work?\nThis article will provide an overview of liquidated damages clauses in Singapore with examples of situations when such a clause may be unenforceable, in particular:\nWhat is a Liquidated Damages Clause?\nAs mentioned above, a liquidated damages clause is a clause in your employment contract which provides for a fixed amount of compensation in the event that you breach the contract.\nFor example, when you sign an employment contract that states that you are bonded to your company for a period of time (e.g. 2 years), or that you are to commence work for the company on a particular date, these are legally binding contractual terms.\nIf you then fail to show up for work on that start date, or choose to terminate your contract before your bond period is over, you will be in\nbreach of contract\n. This entitles your employer to damages that compensate them for the loss suffered by your early termination.\nLDCs may require the payment of a:\nLump sum,\ne.g. “In the event of default by X, X shall pay Y as liquidated damages $__ amount”; or\nPeriodic payments\n, e.g. “In the event of default by X, X shall pay Y as liquidated damages $__ amount for each day of default”.\nIn the context of early termination, a liquidated damages clause could require you to pay a:\nLump-sum worded as a flat fee (e.g. $5,000);\nLump sum consisting of several months of salary; or a\nFixed amount for each calendar day from the time you serve notice to the end of the bond period.\nNot Sure What To Do Next?\nGet a 20-minute phone call with a lawyer for only $59\nArrange a call now\nExamples:\nAdvice on wrongful termination, non-compete clauses etc.\nSelect\nSelect\nNadia Moynihan\nAugust Law Corporation | 11 years experience | English, Malay\nNadia’s practice encompasses Civil and Commercial Litigation, Matrimonial and Syariah Law as well as Criminal Law.

When push comes to shove and marriage is no longer possible, Ronald is able to represent clients for any divorce proceedings, both contested and uncontested.\r\n\r\nRonald is able to speak both the Chinese and English language.\nAm I Liable to Pay Liquidated Damages If I Terminate the Contract Early?\nLDCs can be beneficial to both parties because it provides certainty as to the amount of compensation recoverable. Parties will also not have to expend additional effort and legal costs to prove the amount of compensation that the breaching party is liable for.\nHowever, employers may take advantage of employees by drafting LDCs that impose highly onerous terms, in order to deter employees from terminating their employment contract early.\nIf you are an employee, it is important to note that even if you have willingly signed an employment contract that includes a liquidated damages clause,\nthe liquidated damages clause cannot be enforced against you if it is essentially imposing a\npenalty to punish\nyou for the breach.\nIf your employer tries to enforce the penalty and sues you for compensation, the liquidated damages clause will have no effect.\nWhen is a clause likely to be a penalty clause?\nIf the clause stipulates an amount that is not a genuine pre-estimate of the damage your employer will suffer as a result of your early termination, it is likely to be a penalty.\nIf the amount stipulated is extravagant or unconscionable, such that there is a large discrepancy between it and the likely loss suffered by your employer.\nIf the sum is so disproportionate to the losses your employer may suffer, that its main function is to deter a breach rather than to compensate your employer.\nThe fact that the clause states that it is a “liquidated damages clause” does not prevent it from being a penalty.\nPossible examples of penalty clauses\nA clause that requires an employee on a monthly salary of $2,000 to pay $50 per calendar day from the date of terminating his employment until the 1-year term contract is up. For example, if the employee quits after 3 months, he would be liable for a sum exceeding $9,000. This sum appears to be very high, given that it amounts to 4.5 months’ worth of salary. It is unlikely to be a genuine estimate of losses if the employer cannot provide evidence that the costs of recruiting and training a replacement employee will amount to the sum stipulated.\nA clause that requires the employee to serve a bond of 2 years and to pay a lump sum of $10,000 if he breaks the bond, regardless of the amount of time left on the bond period. The sum is unlikely to be a genuine estimate of losses because it is for a fixed sum that does not take into account the severity of the breach. For example, an employee who quits on the first day of work is likely to cause greater losses to his employer than one who quits towards the end of the bond period.\nExamples of clauses that may be valid liquidated damages clauses\nEmployment contracts\n: Where an employee has contracted to serve a bond of 2 years to the company in exchange for the company sponsoring the employee’s tuition fees, it is likely to be a genuine pre-estimate of the employer’s loss if the liquidated damages clause requires the employee to pay a sum equivalent to the course fees incurred, pro-rated based on the remaining duration of the employee’s bond.\nRecruitment contracts\n: Where a job-seeker has contracted with a recruitment agency to broker an employment opportunity for him, the recruitment agency typically requires the job-seeker to remain employed for a period of time. If the job-seeker later changes his mind and chooses to terminate his employment contract prior to the start date, the recruitment agency may require him to pay 1 month’s salary. This is likely to be a genuine pre-estimate of the recruitment agency’s loss if the early termination resulted in the loss of commission that it could have earned from the employer for assisting the employer with filling a job vacancy.\nWhat Other Compensation Might I Need to Pay If I Terminate a Contract Without Notice?\nYou should note that apart from making payment under a valid liquidated damages clause for early termination, you may also have to make additional payment if you choose not to serve your notice period.\nFor example, where your employment contract stipulates that you must provide X number of months of notice, you are liable to pay compensation in lieu of notice if you wish to terminate the contract without fully serving out your notice.\nThe only exception to having to pay compensation in lieu of notice is if you are terminating your employment contract without notice because your employer has breached the terms of the employment contract.\nFor example, where your employer fails to pay your salary within 7 days of the due date.\nWhat Options are Available to Me?\nIf your employment contract contains a liquidated damages clause and you are considering whether to breach your contract, the following options are open to you:\n1. Fulfil the terms of your employment contract\nYou may wish to continue working for your employer until you can terminate the contract without being in breach. If you do so, you will not be liable to pay your employer compensation.\nHowever, this may not be an attractive option if you are dissatisfied with your job, or have secured a better employment opportunity elsewhere.\n2. Terminate the contract early and pay your employer the compensation under the liquidated damages clause\nThis will allow you to pursue other job opportunities sooner. However, this option may not be appropriate if you cannot afford the sum stipulated in the liquidated damages clause and/or it is disproportionate to the benefit you may gain from early termination.\n3. Negotiate with your employer for a lower liquidated damages sum\nIn persuading your employer to negotiate, it might be helpful to remind them that the alternative of resolving the matter in court (see next point) will likely be a lot more costly and time-consuming for them.\nIn addition, during the negotiations, you should request that your employer provide proof that the sum stipulated in the contract is a genuine estimate of his loss. For example, the employer could provide evidence of the cost of training and recruiting a new employee, or the cost of the fees that the employer has incurred in training you.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that your employer will accept your proposed sum during the negotiations, or agree to negotiate the matter in the first place.\n4. Dispute the liquidated damages clause in court\nIt should be noted that LDCs are not covered by the Employment Act. This means that the Ministry of Manpower will not be able to help you with any dispute concerning the validity of a liquidated damages clause, and it must be settled by the Singapore courts instead.\nFor example, if you terminate your contract early, your employer may bring a claim for liquidated damages against you in court. You can then dispute the liquidated damages clause and argue that it should be struck down because it is an unenforceable penalty clause.\nThe courts will then examine the liquidated damages clause, and the other terms of your employment contract, to decide if the liquidated damages clause is enforceable. If the court agrees with you that the liquidated damages clause is unenforceable, it will determine the amount of damages you should actually pay instead (after all, you have still breached your contract).\nIn making this determination, the court will take into account the loss suffered by your employer as a result of your early termination. This amount will likely be less than the sum stipulated in the liquidated damages clause.\nHowever, this course of action comes with risks. If you lose the lawsuit (for example, the court decides that the liquidated damages clause is enforceable), you are liable for the amount stipulated in the liquidated damages clause. Additionally, you may have to bear the legal fees incurred by your employer, which can amount to a hefty sum.

Liquidated damages clauses can pose concerns to employees who wish to quit their job before their employment term is up.\nAdditionally, it can place job-seekers in a dilemma when they have signed an employment contract with Company A, only to receive a more attractive offer from Company B – will they be liable to pay Company A $X if they choose to break their contract before their first day of work?\nThis article will provide an overview of liquidated damages clauses in Singapore with examples of situations when such a clause may be unenforceable, in particular:\nWhat is a Liquidated Damages Clause?\nAs mentioned above, a liquidated damages clause is a clause in your employment contract which provides for a fixed amount of compensation in the event that you breach the contract.\nFor example, when you sign an employment contract that states that you are bonded to your company for a period of time (e.g. 2 years), or that you are to commence work for the company on a particular date, these are legally binding contractual terms.\nIf you then fail to show up for work on that start date, or choose to terminate your contract before your bond period is over, you will be in\nbreach of contract\n. This entitles your employer to damages that compensate them for the loss suffered by your early termination.\nLDCs may require the payment of a:\nLump sum,\ne.g. “In the event of default by X, X shall pay Y as liquidated damages $__ amount”; or\nPeriodic payments\n, e.g. “In the event of default by X, X shall pay Y as liquidated damages $__ amount for each day of default”.\nIn the context of early termination, a liquidated damages clause could require you to pay a:\nLump-sum worded as a flat fee (e.g. $5,000);\nLump sum consisting of several months of salary; or a\nFixed amount for each calendar day from the time you serve notice to the end of the bond period.\nNot Sure What To Do Next?\nGet a 20-minute phone call with a lawyer for only $59\nArrange a call now\nExamples:\nAdvice on wrongful termination, non-compete clauses etc.\nSelect\nSelect\nNadia Moynihan\nAugust Law Corporation | 11 years experience | English, Malay\nNadia’s practice encompasses Civil and Commercial Litigation, Matrimonial and Syariah Law as well as Criminal Law.

Parties will also not have to expend additional effort and legal costs to prove the amount of compensation that the breaching party is liable for.\nHowever, employers may take advantage of employees by drafting LDCs that impose highly onerous terms, in order to deter employees from terminating their employment contract early.\nIf you are an employee, it is important to note that even if you have willingly signed an employment contract that includes a liquidated damages clause,\nthe liquidated damages clause cannot be enforced against you if it is essentially imposing a\npenalty to punish\nyou for the breach.\nIf your employer tries to enforce the penalty and sues you for compensation, the liquidated damages clause will have no effect.\nWhen is a clause likely to be a penalty clause?\nIf the clause stipulates an amount that is not a genuine pre-estimate of the damage your employer will suffer as a result of your early termination, it is likely to be a penalty.\nIf the amount stipulated is extravagant or unconscionable, such that there is a large discrepancy between it and the likely loss suffered by your employer.\nIf the sum is so disproportionate to the losses your employer may suffer, that its main function is to deter a breach rather than to compensate your employer.\nThe fact that the clause states that it is a “liquidated damages clause” does not prevent it from being a penalty.\nPossible examples of penalty clauses\nA clause that requires an employee on a monthly salary of $2,000 to pay $50 per calendar day from the date of terminating his employment until the 1-year term contract is up. For example, if the employee quits after 3 months, he would be liable for a sum exceeding $9,000. This sum appears to be very high, given that it amounts to 4.5 months’ worth of salary. It is unlikely to be a genuine estimate of losses if the employer cannot provide evidence that the costs of recruiting and training a replacement employee will amount to the sum stipulated.\nA clause that requires the employee to serve a bond of 2 years and to pay a lump sum of $10,000 if he breaks the bond, regardless of the amount of time left on the bond period. The sum is unlikely to be a genuine estimate of losses because it is for a fixed sum that does not take into account the severity of the breach. For example, an employee who quits on the first day of work is likely to cause greater losses to his employer than one who quits towards the end of the bond period.\nExamples of clauses that may be valid liquidated damages clauses\nEmployment contracts\n: Where an employee has contracted to serve a bond of 2 years to the company in exchange for the company sponsoring the employee’s tuition fees, it is likely to be a genuine pre-estimate of the employer’s loss if the liquidated damages clause requires the employee to pay a sum equivalent to the course fees incurred, pro-rated based on the remaining duration of the employee’s bond.\nRecruitment contracts\n: Where a job-seeker has contracted with a recruitment agency to broker an employment opportunity for him, the recruitment agency typically requires the job-seeker to remain employed for a period of time. If the job-seeker later changes his mind and chooses to terminate his employment contract prior to the start date, the recruitment agency may require him to pay 1 month’s salary. This is likely to be a genuine pre-estimate of the recruitment agency’s loss if the early termination resulted in the loss of commission that it could have earned from the employer for assisting the employer with filling a job vacancy.\nWhat Other Compensation Might I Need to Pay If I Terminate a Contract Without Notice?\nYou should note that apart from making payment under a valid liquidated damages clause for early termination, you may also have to make additional payment if you choose not to serve your notice period.\nFor example, where your employment contract stipulates that you must provide X number of months of notice, you are liable to pay compensation in lieu of notice if you wish to terminate the contract without fully serving out your notice.\nThe only exception to having to pay compensation in lieu of notice is if you are terminating your employment contract without notice because your employer has breached the terms of the employment contract.\nFor example, where your employer fails to pay your salary within 7 days of the due date.\nWhat Options are Available to Me?\nIf your employment contract contains a liquidated damages clause and you are considering whether to breach your contract, the following options are open to you:\n1. Fulfil the terms of your employment contract\nYou may wish to continue working for your employer until you can terminate the contract without being in breach. If you do so, you will not be liable to pay your employer compensation.\nHowever, this may not be an attractive option if you are dissatisfied with your job, or have secured a better employment opportunity elsewhere.\n2. Terminate the contract early and pay your employer the compensation under the liquidated damages clause\nThis will allow you to pursue other job opportunities sooner. However, this option may not be appropriate if you cannot afford the sum stipulated in the liquidated damages clause and/or it is disproportionate to the benefit you may gain from early termination.\n3. Negotiate with your employer for a lower liquidated damages sum\nIn persuading your employer to negotiate, it might be helpful to remind them that the alternative of resolving the matter in court (see next point) will likely be a lot more costly and time-consuming for them.\nIn addition, during the negotiations, you should request that your employer provide proof that the sum stipulated in the contract is a genuine estimate of his loss. For example, the employer could provide evidence of the cost of training and recruiting a new employee, or the cost of the fees that the employer has incurred in training you.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that your employer will accept your proposed sum during the negotiations, or agree to negotiate the matter in the first place.\n4. Dispute the liquidated damages clause in court\nIt should be noted that LDCs are not covered by the Employment Act. This means that the Ministry of Manpower will not be able to help you with any dispute concerning the validity of a liquidated damages clause, and it must be settled by the Singapore courts instead.\nFor example, if you terminate your contract early, your employer may bring a claim for liquidated damages against you in court. You can then dispute the liquidated damages clause and argue that it should be struck down because it is an unenforceable penalty clause.\nThe courts will then examine the liquidated damages clause, and the other terms of your employment contract, to decide if the liquidated damages clause is enforceable. If the court agrees with you that the liquidated damages clause is unenforceable, it will determine the amount of damages you should actually pay instead (after all, you have still breached your contract).\nIn making this determination, the court will take into account the loss suffered by your employer as a result of your early termination. This amount will likely be less than the sum stipulated in the liquidated damages clause.\nHowever, this course of action comes with risks. If you lose the lawsuit (for example, the court decides that the liquidated damages clause is enforceable), you are liable for the amount stipulated in the liquidated damages clause. Additionally, you may have to bear the legal fees incurred by your employer, which can amount to a hefty sum. This is not including the legal fees that you will have to pay your own lawyers (if you have hired any).\n—\nBefore proceeding with any of the above options, it is recommended that you\nseek legal advice from a lawyer who specialises in Singapore employment disputes\n.\nAn employment disputes lawyer can provide you with an assessment of the likelihood that the liquidated damages clause is enforceable against you, and therefore assist you in making an informed choice on whether you should terminate your contract early.\nAfter all, whether a liquidated damages clause amounts to a penalty clause is highly contextual. As the law surrounding this area can be complicated, you will strongly benefit from a professional assessment.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

This process, when carried out, is known as a retrenchment exercise.\nRetrenchment may also occur in situations where the employer’s company undergoes liquidation, receivership or\njudicial management\n, or any other\nwinding up\nprocess.\nWhen undergoing a retrenchment exercise, however, employers have certain obligations to take note of and employees have certain rights.\nSelection of Employees for Retrenchment\nAs set out in the\nTripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment\n(referred to as the “Advisory” in this article), the selection of employees for retrenchment should be based on objective criteria and conducted in a fair manner.\nAlthough the Advisory is not legally binding on employers, it outlines progressive workplace practices that employers should adopt.

This process, when carried out, is known as a retrenchment exercise.\nRetrenchment may also occur in situations where the employer’s company undergoes liquidation, receivership or\njudicial management\n, or any other\nwinding up\nprocess.\nWhen undergoing a retrenchment exercise, however, employers have certain obligations to take note of and employees have certain rights.\nSelection of Employees for Retrenchment\nAs set out in the\nTripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment\n(referred to as the “Advisory” in this article), the selection of employees for retrenchment should be based on objective criteria and conducted in a fair manner.\nAlthough the Advisory is not legally binding on employers, it outlines progressive workplace practices that employers should adopt. This involves taking into account the following non-exhaustive factors when conducting a retrenchment exercise:\nAbility of employee to contribute to the company’s future business needs;\nNo discrimination against a group on grounds of;\nAge\nRace\nGender\nReligion\nMarital status\nFamily responsibility (e.g. pregnant employees)\nDisability\nNo deprivation of employee entitlements or benefits (e.g.\nmaternity leave\n); or\nNo punishment for exercising employee rights (e.g. filing a salary-related claim).\nAdherence to these objective guidelines is important to avoid liability in the event disgruntled employees commence legal proceedings against an employer for\nunfair dismissal\n.\nPrior to Conducting a Retrenchment Exercise\nNotification of TAFEP and/or the Relevant Union\nIt is not mandatory to\ninform the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)\nof the retrenchment exercise.

{"chunk_id": "SLA_19fb2637", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "When Should Singapore Employers Use a Deed of Release?", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Letting Go Of Employees > When Should Singapore Employers Use a Deed of Release?", "text": "When Should Singapore Employers Use a Deed of Release?\nLast updated on October 17, 2024\nWhen an employee leaves a company, there may be legal issues involved, such as outstanding obligations between a company and the employee, or the potential for an employment-related claim against the company.\nOne way to address these legal issues is through signing a deed of release. This article will look at:\nWhat is a Deed of Release?\nA deed of release, sometimes called a deed of settlement, is generally used to resolve a legal dispute by releasing parties of their legal obligations to each other.\nIn an employment context, a deed of release can resolve or prevent disputes between a company and an employee. It can do this by:\nReleasing the company from employment-related claims\n. If an employee has a potentially valid employment claim against the company, he can choose to give this up in exchange for some form of payment.\nIntroducing new obligations that state how any existing legal obligations can be released\n. When an employee leaves a company, there may still be deliverables owed to the company. Alternatively, the company may owe the employee some entitlements such as wages, bonuses or leave. In such cases, these existing legal obligations can first be clarified (expressly stated in the deed), followed by an agreement on how such obligations can be released. For example, an employee that is owed leave can have that leave encashed via a deed of release with the company, if both parties are agreeable.\nIntroducing restrictions on the employee after leaving the company\n. For example, a deed of release can contain confidentiality or non-disparagement clauses. The confidentiality clause can require the employee to not release sensitive information to the public, while the non-disparagement clause requires the employee to avoid making damaging remarks about the company. These clauses are useful when departing employees may possess sensitive information about the company, or hold grudges against the company.\nHow is a Deed of Release Different from an Employment Contract?\nWhile a deed of release is legally binding and can be enforced in court just like an employment contract, deeds of release differ from employment contracts in some ways.\nFirst,\na termination clause in an employment contract usually does not clarify or release existing obligations\n. A termination or resignation clause is typically limited to the conditions and mechanisms to end an employment relationship. For example, a termination clause may only state that a company can terminate an employee for poor performance after a specified notice period. It may not state any existing obligations between the parties at the time of termination and how these obligations can be released.\nSecond,\na resignation or termination clause in an employment contract will generally not protect the company from employment-related claims\n. Unlike a deed of release, a resignation or termination clause in the employment contract does not release the company from any employment-related claim that an employee might bring against it.\nWhen Should I Use a Deed of Release?\nA deed of release is best used to resolve a dispute or prevent one from occurring in the first place, especially when a company is parting ways with an employee on bad terms. Thus, a deed of release can be useful:\nWhen you wish to protect your company against employment-related claims by the affected employee\nAs the deed of release can discharge legal obligations between parties, it can help prevent one party from bringing a claim against the other party. This saves legal costs and time by avoiding possible litigation.\nWhen the cost of any potential employment-related claim is higher than a settlement\nDo note that the cost of any employment-related claim is not limited to the claim being made. There are litigation and mental costs as well, such as the lawyer and court fees, and mental stress. It may be more cost-effective to offer a settlement instead. Here, a deed of release may be helpful because it allows both parties to arrive at a fair settlement amount without worrying about additional costs that come with litigation.\nWhen there is a big reputational risk to your company\nAn aggrieved employee with significant influence over your clients may be at risk of badmouthing your company to the clients, damaging your reputation. Challenging those remarks in court may cost you time and money while failing to repair the relationship with your clients. In this regard, having your employee sign a deed of release with a non-disparagement clause may be more effective in preventing the employee from making negative remarks on your company to others.\nWhen you want both parties to negotiate a satisfactory agreement that meets both their interests\nA deed of release allows for a negotiation process where an employee can air his or her grievances. Negotiation can increase the goodwill between the employee and the employer and reduce the chances of a formal claim being filed. Further, the goodwill generated can also lead to a more favourable settlement amount for the employer, or a greater willingness on the part of the employee to accept a release of the employer’s obligations.\nWhat are Some Disadvantages of Using a Deed of Release?\nDespite the potential benefits of a deed of release, it does come with several drawbacks. Do keep the following considerations in mind when deciding to use a deed of release.\nFirst,\nan employee may not accept the deed of release\n. This is especially true if the deed imposes additional and onerous obligations.\nSecond, your company may incur\nadditional costs in drafting and meeting its obligations in the deed of release\n. These additional costs may be the result of providing adequate compensation for the additional obligations imposed by the deed of release on the employee.\nLast,\nyou may not be able to avoid litigation\n. For example, if the employee breaches the term of the deed, you may have to enforce the deed in court.\nHow to Draft a Deed of Release\nA deed of release should minimally clarify and protect the interests of both parties. You may want to consider including the following clauses to help you do so.\nA description of the reasons for the employee’s termination\nDetailing the reasons for the employee’s termination may be useful for both the company and the employee. For the company, it can show that the employee has accepted the reasons for termination. For the employee, such a description may indicate how the termination will be communicated to the rest of the company and help preserve his or her reputation.\nA clarification of any outstanding obligations between both parties\nClarifications on any outstanding obligations can include any payments owed to the employee because of entitlements, such as annual leave or bonus payments, or whether any restraint of trade clauses apply to the employee.\nA clause releasing the company from future legal claims by the employee in exchange for a payment to the employee\nA typical release clause would include details of the legal obligations being released. For example, it may state that an employer is being released of any claims for unfair dismissal, or that an employee is being released for any negligence during his or her course of work. Do note that some legal obligations cannot be released. One example is the employer’s making of Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions on the employee’s behalf (see below).\nA payment clause\nWhere the employer has agreed to compensate the employee for releasing the employer of his legal obligations, the deed of release may include a clause detailing the amount to be paid. The payment clause can also include the other payments owed to the employee, such as the encashment of leave or any outstanding wages.\nA confidentiality clause\nA confidentiality clause will require the parties to not disclose sensitive information to the public, whether such information relates to the deed of release or the details of the employment and dismissal.\nA non-disparagement clause\nA non-disparagement clause can require one party to avoid making damaging remarks against the other party, or both parties to avoid making such remarks about each other. This clause can help protect the reputation of your company and is especially useful when dealing with an aggrieved employee.\nCan a Deed of Release be Set Aside?\nWhile a deed of release is a legally binding agreement that can be enforced in court, there are some exceptions when the deed can be set aside and made unenforceable after being signed.\nWhen a deed is not voluntarily entered into\nIf an employee felt pressured or forced into signing a deed of release, he or she may be able to have the deed set aside by the court. It may be wise to allow employees sufficient time to consider the deed properly and seek legal advice before signing.\nWhen a company tries to shirk its legal obligations through a deed\nThere are some statutory obligations on an employer that cannot be avoided through a deed of release. For example, in Singapore, employers are legally required to\ncontribute to their employees’ CPF accounts\n.\nA clause in the deed of release that discharges a company from paying its employee’s outstanding CPF contributions may be set aside by the court.\nWhen either party breaches the deed of release\nIf a party fails to fulfil its obligations under the deed, the court may allow the other party to set aside the deed of release. This may then free the other party from having to fulfil any of its remaining obligations under a deed.\nFor example, if the company fails to pay the employee under the deed, then the employee may no longer be prevented from subsequently bringing a claim against the company.\nNevertheless, if the deed of release is enforceable and has been breached by your employee, you may be able to claim\ncompensation for breach of the deed\n, or an\ninjunction\nto restrain the employee from continuing with his or her acts.\n—\nA deed of release can be very useful in protecting your company when parting with an aggrieved employee. It can guard against litigation and reputational damage through a legally binding agreement.\nHowever, the enforceability of a deed of release will depend on many factors, from the clarity of the terms used to whether the employee had voluntarily agreed to the terms in the deed. Having a lawyer help you in the drafting and negotiating of the deed can help ensure that the deed is enforceable and will be complied with. Further, if your employee breaches the deed, a lawyer can advise you on the steps to enforce a valid deed.\nDo\ncontact an employment lawyer\nif you are considering issuing an employee a deed of release.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

If so, you might have come across the term “blacklisting” and its use in the employment context.\nThis article will explore whether such a practice is legal, and whether there are alternatives to “blacklisting” a foreign or local ex-employee in Singapore. It will cover:\nWhat is “Blacklisting”?\n“Blacklisting” refers to actions taken that make it more difficult for employees to get hired elsewhere after leaving their previous employment. Such actions can be undertaken by the employers themselves, in the form of circulating a message to others in the industry to not hire the ex-employee, or providing a bad reference when a prospective employer calls to inquire about the ex-employee.\nAlternatively, “blacklisting” can also be done by government authorities in certain situations, as will be elaborated on below.\nCan Employers Blacklist an Employee in Singapore?\nEmployers in Singapore do not have the final say as to whether an ex-employee is to be “blacklisted” or prevented from working in Singapore. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM), as the government agency responsible for the implementation of employment laws and regulations in Singapore, is the authority that decides whether someone is eligible to work in Singapore.\nHowever, after terminating the employment of their employee, which employers are entitled to do in the event of employee misconduct, employers can take certain steps that can have the effect of “blacklisting” their ex-employees.\nFor\nforeign employees\n, employers can indicate to MOM that they wish to provide a reference for their ex-employee, and that they wish to share what they observed about the ex-employee’s conduct, character, work attitude or performance. Such foreign employees can be employment pass holders, work permit holders or\nforeign domestic workers\n.\nIf they are keen to provide a reference, employers will have to leave their personal details and contact details, as well as the details of the ex-employee with MOM using the appropriate feedback forms:\nWork pass type\nFeedback form\nEmployment Pass, S Pass and other passes\nYou can access the feedback form here\n.\nWork Permit\nYou can access the feedback form here\n.\nThen, upon receiving an application by a prospective employer for a work pass for the same employee, MOM will inform the prospective employer that they have received feedback about the employee. If the prospective employer wishes to find out more, MOM will connect them with the ex-employer who had provided the reference.\nIf the prospective employer does not wish to find out more, or if they decide to hire the employee even after receiving the feedback, MOM will proceed to process the application as per normal.\nApart from this process of accepting references by employers, MOM also maintains a list of foreigners who are banned from obtaining employment in Singapore because they have previously been found guilty of an offence under Singapore law, including offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act or criminal offences.\nFor local employees\n, employers can lodge a complaint with MOM regarding their local employee’s behaviour. However, it is up to MOM to decide if any further action should be taken with respect to those employees.\nWhat are the Offences Employers Can be Penalised For When Blacklisting Employees?\nEmployers who wish to “blacklist” ex-employees of their own accord should be wary of committing other offences in the process, which they can be penalised for.\nFor example, after terminating their contract of service with an ex-employee, one particular employer wanted to inform prospective employers in the industry about that ex-employee and\nsent out emails to discourage them from hiring him\n. In breach of the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Act, however, the employer included the name and identity card number of the ex-employee in the emails without his consent. As a result, the employer was issued a warning by the Personal Data Protection Commission.\nOther than falling foul of the Personal Data Protection Act, employers who “blacklist” ex-employees could also potentially be committing other criminal offences such as:\nOffence\nDescription\nExamples\nCriminal intimidation\nIt is an offence to threaten another person with any injury to his/her person, reputation or property, with intent to cause alarm to that person.\nThreatening to reveal information of an ex-employee that will hurt his/her reputation if he/she seeks employment in the same industry.\nIn the process of “blacklisting” their ex-employee, threatening to reveal information of that ex-employee that will hurt his/her reputation if he/she makes a complaint to MOM.\nCausing harassment, alarm or distress\nIt is an offence to use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour or make any threatening, abusive or insulting communication, which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived by any person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.\nUsing abusive language towards an ex-employee when warning him/her to not seek employment in the same industry, or when threatening to blacklist the ex-employee.\nAdditionally, while “blacklisting” might not be discriminatory\nper se\n, employers should be aware of the need to abide by fair employment practices at all times. This means that they should be recruiting, assessing and dismissing employees on the basis of their merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), instead of on the basis of the employee’s age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities or disability.\nTherefore, an employer must not “blacklist” an ex-employee for reasons other than merit or employee misconduct (which could include theft, dishonesty, disorderly or immoral conduct at work and insubordination). Employers who do so can be penalised by MOM.\nYou may wish to read our other article to find out about\nSingapore’s upcoming anti-discrimination laws and what employers should be aware of\n.\nWhat are Alternatives to Blacklisting an Employee?\nAs mentioned above, one alternative to “blacklisting” an employee is to either indicate that you wish to provide a reference for your foreign ex-employee, or to write to MOM to lodge a complaint or provide feedback about a local employee’s behaviour.\nAdditionally, conducting the appropriate background checks on prospective employees prior to their employment may also prevent the need to blacklist them in the future.\nFor example, if you are looking to employ a foreign domestic worker, you can obtain the employment history of the worker from the employment agency, or from the Work Permit Online system accessible via MOM’s website.\n—\nAs an alternative to “blacklisting” ex-employees, there are readily available channels to report the behaviour of ex-employees to MOM, which can serve the same purpose of alerting other prospective employers about them.\nHowever, if you have been charged with a blacklisting-related offence, like one of the offences stated above, you might want to consider\nengaging a lawyer\nwho can help you assess the merits of your position and advise on your legal options moving forward.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

If so, you might have come across the term “blacklisting” and its use in the employment context.\nThis article will explore whether such a practice is legal, and whether there are alternatives to “blacklisting” a foreign or local ex-employee in Singapore. It will cover:\nWhat is “Blacklisting”?\n“Blacklisting” refers to actions taken that make it more difficult for employees to get hired elsewhere after leaving their previous employment. Such actions can be undertaken by the employers themselves, in the form of circulating a message to others in the industry to not hire the ex-employee, or providing a bad reference when a prospective employer calls to inquire about the ex-employee.\nAlternatively, “blacklisting” can also be done by government authorities in certain situations, as will be elaborated on below.\nCan Employers Blacklist an Employee in Singapore?\nEmployers in Singapore do not have the final say as to whether an ex-employee is to be “blacklisted” or prevented from working in Singapore. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM), as the government agency responsible for the implementation of employment laws and regulations in Singapore, is the authority that decides whether someone is eligible to work in Singapore.\nHowever, after terminating the employment of their employee, which employers are entitled to do in the event of employee misconduct, employers can take certain steps that can have the effect of “blacklisting” their ex-employees.\nFor\nforeign employees\n, employers can indicate to MOM that they wish to provide a reference for their ex-employee, and that they wish to share what they observed about the ex-employee’s conduct, character, work attitude or performance. Such foreign employees can be employment pass holders, work permit holders or\nforeign domestic workers\n.\nIf they are keen to provide a reference, employers will have to leave their personal details and contact details, as well as the details of the ex-employee with MOM using the appropriate feedback forms:\nWork pass type\nFeedback form\nEmployment Pass, S Pass and other passes\nYou can access the feedback form here\n.\nWork Permit\nYou can access the feedback form here\n.\nThen, upon receiving an application by a prospective employer for a work pass for the same employee, MOM will inform the prospective employer that they have received feedback about the employee. If the prospective employer wishes to find out more, MOM will connect them with the ex-employer who had provided the reference.\nIf the prospective employer does not wish to find out more, or if they decide to hire the employee even after receiving the feedback, MOM will proceed to process the application as per normal.\nApart from this process of accepting references by employers, MOM also maintains a list of foreigners who are banned from obtaining employment in Singapore because they have previously been found guilty of an offence under Singapore law, including offences under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act or criminal offences.\nFor local employees\n, employers can lodge a complaint with MOM regarding their local employee’s behaviour. However, it is up to MOM to decide if any further action should be taken with respect to those employees.\nWhat are the Offences Employers Can be Penalised For When Blacklisting Employees?\nEmployers who wish to “blacklist” ex-employees of their own accord should be wary of committing other offences in the process, which they can be penalised for.\nFor example, after terminating their contract of service with an ex-employee, one particular employer wanted to inform prospective employers in the industry about that ex-employee and\nsent out emails to discourage them from hiring him\n. In breach of the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Act, however, the employer included the name and identity card number of the ex-employee in the emails without his consent. As a result, the employer was issued a warning by the Personal Data Protection Commission.\nOther than falling foul of the Personal Data Protection Act, employers who “blacklist” ex-employees could also potentially be committing other criminal offences such as:\nOffence\nDescription\nExamples\nCriminal intimidation\nIt is an offence to threaten another person with any injury to his/her person, reputation or property, with intent to cause alarm to that person.\nThreatening to reveal information of an ex-employee that will hurt his/her reputation if he/she seeks employment in the same industry.\nIn the process of “blacklisting” their ex-employee, threatening to reveal information of that ex-employee that will hurt his/her reputation if he/she makes a complaint to MOM.\nCausing harassment, alarm or distress\nIt is an offence to use any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour or make any threatening, abusive or insulting communication, which is heard, seen or otherwise perceived by any person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.\nUsing abusive language towards an ex-employee when warning him/her to not seek employment in the same industry, or when threatening to blacklist the ex-employee.\nAdditionally, while “blacklisting” might not be discriminatory\nper se\n, employers should be aware of the need to abide by fair employment practices at all times. This means that they should be recruiting, assessing and dismissing employees on the basis of their merit (such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job), instead of on the basis of the employee’s age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities or disability.\nTherefore, an employer must not “blacklist” an ex-employee for reasons other than merit or employee misconduct (which could include theft, dishonesty, disorderly or immoral conduct at work and insubordination).

This process, however, entails certain legal obligations and implications on both parties that must be abided by in accordance with the relevant employment-related legislation, as well as any of the terms and conditions that are set out in the employment contract.\nIf you are negatively affected by the termination of your employment, there may be possible avenues of legal action that you may undertake, as set out below.\nIn this article, we will cover what is termination of employment and the various ways in which an employment relationship can be terminated:\nWhat is Termination of Employment?\nTermination of employment refers to the end of an individual’s employment with a particular business or company, which may be voluntary or involuntary. According to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), when either you or the employer wants to end the employment relationship, you may do so by terminating the contract of service.\nThe Employment Act (EA)\ncovers any person who has entered into a contract of service and also governs the termination of employment. Specific examples include:\nDuration of contract\n:\nSection 9 of the EA\nlays out that a contract for a specified piece of work or period of time will be terminated when such work is completed, or the period of time for which the contract was made has expired.\nDuration and manner of notice of termination\n:\nSection 10 of the EA\nlays out the requirement for the notice of termination to be the same for both employer and employee. The notice must be done in writing and can be given at any time. An employer’s notice period would vary depending on the terms of their contract or the employee’s period of employment. The day on which the notice is given should also be included in the period of notice.\nTerminating your employment without waiting for the notice to expire\n:\nSection 11 of the EA\nlays out such an exception, provided that payment is made to the other party in accordance with the terms of their contract. Alternatively, either party may terminate the contract without notice if there is any wilful breach by the other party of a condition of the contract.\nTerminating your employment as a minor\n:\nSection 12 of the EA\nstates\nthat no contract of service as an employee is enforceable against a person below 18 years of age, and no damages or indemnity are recoverable from that person in respect of the contract of service unless it is for his or her benefit.\nFor further information, please refer to our other article on the\nEmployment Act and its scope\n.\nWhat are the Various Ways in which an Employment Relationship Can be Terminated?\nTermination with notice\nTermination with notice happens when:\nYou resign; or\nYour employer wishes to terminate your employment.\nIn either of these situations, you must serve notice or pay compensation in lieu of notice\n. However, notice can be waived by mutual written consent between you and your employer.\nA written termination letter is mandatory for you to be considered as having formally left the company, and you must ask your employer to give you a signed letter if you did not receive it. Do note that a reason from either party for termination is not required if notice has been given to the other party.\nYour notice period is largely dependent on the terms specified in your employment contract. If it is unspecified, the notice period will depend on your length of service. The notice period includes the day on which the notice is given, public holidays, rest days, and non-working days.\nYou can refer to\nthis\ntable provided by the MOM which stipulates the notice period required according to the length of service, along with other essential calculations.\nTermination without notice\nTermination without notice happens when:\nYou wish to resign; or\nYour employer wishes to terminate your employment without giving notice.\nEither party will have to pay salary in lieu of notice. This means paying the other party an amount equivalent to the salary that would have been earned during the required notice period, instead of giving advance notice of your termination. The party that has breached the terms of the employment must pay salary in lieu of notice. Examples of situations where such termination may occur include:\nBreaking the terms of the contract. Examples include your employer failing to pay your salary within 7 days of it being due. In this case, the onus for compensation lies with the employer.\nEmployee being continuously absent from work for more than 2 working days, either without approval and a good excuse or without informing and attempting to inform your employer of the reason. In this case, the onus of compensation lies on you as the employee.\nChanges to the terms and conditions of work where there is no agreement or consent such as a change in the required notice period. In this case, the onus of compensation lies on the employer.\nDo note that in addition to salary in lieu of notice, either party may be required to pay compensation for terminating the contract before a specified period. Such terms are, however, not covered by the EA and are based on the contract of service. As such, any disputes have to be settled by the civil court.\nTermination due to employee misconduct\nMisconduct, according to the MOM, is the failure to fulfil the conditions of employment in the contract of service. Examples include dishonesty and insubordination. For instance, an employee could have either provided untruthful or false information in their job application, or refused to comply with the directions issued in the workplace without valid reasons.\nCases of employee misconduct will result in either a formal inquiry or internal investigations, depending on the severity of the case before any disciplinary action is taken.\nWhile there is no fixed procedure for such inquiry, you may\nrefer to this MOM page for an overview of the inquiry process\n.\nUpon conducting the inquiry, if there is:\nMisconduct, the employer can instantly downgrade the employee, suspend the employee from work without pay for a maximum of 1 week, or terminate employment without notice, and no salary in lieu of notice will be paid.\nNo misconduct, the employer must restore the full amount of any salary that was withheld during the suspension period.\nYou may also refer to this article on\nhandling cases of employee misconduct in Singapore\nfor a more detailed discussion.\nWrongful dismissal\nWrongful dismissal occurs when an employee is dismissed without just or sufficient cause. Examples of wrongful dismissal include:\nDismissal based on discriminatory grounds such as:\nAge;\nRace;\nReligion;\nDisability;\nMarital status;\nD\nepriving an employee of their benefits or entitlements (whether provided under statute or by the employer) that they would have otherwise earned or received in the ordinary course of their employment (e.g., maternity benefits, or retirement benefits);\nPunishing an employee for exercising their employment rights (e.g., filing a mediation request for unpaid salaries or being unwilling to work beyond contractual hours).\nOn the other hand, a valid dismissal is based on reasons such as poor performance according to the required standards of the employer, redundancy, or employee misconduct.\nBoth employers and employees should refer to the\nTripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal\nfor more information on what would amount to wrongful dismissal.\nIf you believe that you have been wrongfully dismissed, here are some steps that you can consider taking:\nTry to speak with your employer or the HR department in your company to resolve the matter amicably first.\nIf the matter cannot be internally resolved, you can proceed with a claim in court or with a mediation claim with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for both statutory and contractual salary-related claims, and wrongful dismissal claims which have a high rate of success. Note that if you believe you have been wrongfully dismissed specifically due to your age or have been denied re-employment, you should submit an appeal to the MOM on those grounds\nhere\ninstead of submitting it to the TADM.\nIf the claims cannot be resolved at the TADM, you can file for an appeal and have your case referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT). If the ECT judges find that your dismissal is wrongful, your employer will be ordered to either reinstate you to your former job and pay you for any income loss due to the wrongful dismissal or pay you a sum of money as compensation.\nYou should file any statutory and contractual salary-related claims within 6 months from the last day of work if you are no longer employed, or within 1 year after the arising of the dispute if you are still employed.\nOn the other hand, wrongful dismissal claims at the TADM should be filed within 1 month from the last day of your employment, or within 2 months from the date of confinement for pregnant employees. Note that if you are a manager or executive, you can only file a wrongful dismissal claim if you have worked for at least 6 months at the job at which you were dismissed. Filing for a claim at the TADM will allow you to claim up to $20,000 or up to $30,000 if you go through the Tripartite Mediation Framework assisted by unions recognised under the Industrial Relations Act.\n—\nTo recap, termination of the employment relationship can happen in four different ways depending on the situation. A good rule of thumb to follow across these various scenarios would be to seek resolution of the matter amicably where possible. Depending on the nature of the termination, various avenues for legal recourse may also be available.\nIt is recommended that you consult an\nemployment lawyer in Singapore\nfor legal advice or assistance if you have had your employment terminated to determine your rights and potential remedies, if any.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

For instance, an employee could have either provided untruthful or false information in their job application, or refused to comply with the directions issued in the workplace without valid reasons.\nCases of employee misconduct will result in either a formal inquiry or internal investigations, depending on the severity of the case before any disciplinary action is taken.\nWhile there is no fixed procedure for such inquiry, you may\nrefer to this MOM page for an overview of the inquiry process\n.\nUpon conducting the inquiry, if there is:\nMisconduct, the employer can instantly downgrade the employee, suspend the employee from work without pay for a maximum of 1 week, or terminate employment without notice, and no salary in lieu of notice will be paid.\nNo misconduct, the employer must restore the full amount of any salary that was withheld during the suspension period.\nYou may also refer to this article on\nhandling cases of employee misconduct in Singapore\nfor a more detailed discussion.\nWrongful dismissal\nWrongful dismissal occurs when an employee is dismissed without just or sufficient cause. Examples of wrongful dismissal include:\nDismissal based on discriminatory grounds such as:\nAge;\nRace;\nReligion;\nDisability;\nMarital status;\nD\nepriving an employee of their benefits or entitlements (whether provided under statute or by the employer) that they would have otherwise earned or received in the ordinary course of their employment (e.g., maternity benefits, or retirement benefits);\nPunishing an employee for exercising their employment rights (e.g., filing a mediation request for unpaid salaries or being unwilling to work beyond contractual hours).\nOn the other hand, a valid dismissal is based on reasons such as poor performance according to the required standards of the employer, redundancy, or employee misconduct.\nBoth employers and employees should refer to the\nTripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal\nfor more information on what would amount to wrongful dismissal.\nIf you believe that you have been wrongfully dismissed, here are some steps that you can consider taking:\nTry to speak with your employer or the HR department in your company to resolve the matter amicably first.\nIf the matter cannot be internally resolved, you can proceed with a claim in court or with a mediation claim with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) for both statutory and contractual salary-related claims, and wrongful dismissal claims which have a high rate of success. Note that if you believe you have been wrongfully dismissed specifically due to your age or have been denied re-employment, you should submit an appeal to the MOM on those grounds\nhere\ninstead of submitting it to the TADM.\nIf the claims cannot be resolved at the TADM, you can file for an appeal and have your case referred to the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT). If the ECT judges find that your dismissal is wrongful, your employer will be ordered to either reinstate you to your former job and pay you for any income loss due to the wrongful dismissal or pay you a sum of money as compensation.\nYou should file any statutory and contractual salary-related claims within 6 months from the last day of work if you are no longer employed, or within 1 year after the arising of the dispute if you are still employed.\nOn the other hand, wrongful dismissal claims at the TADM should be filed within 1 month from the last day of your employment, or within 2 months from the date of confinement for pregnant employees. Note that if you are a manager or executive, you can only file a wrongful dismissal claim if you have worked for at least 6 months at the job at which you were dismissed. Filing for a claim at the TADM will allow you to claim up to $20,000 or up to $30,000 if you go through the Tripartite Mediation Framework assisted by unions recognised under the Industrial Relations Act.\n—\nTo recap, termination of the employment relationship can happen in four different ways depending on the situation. A good rule of thumb to follow across these various scenarios would be to seek resolution of the matter amicably where possible. Depending on the nature of the termination, various avenues for legal recourse may also be available.\nIt is recommended that you consult an\nemployment lawyer in Singapore\nfor legal advice or assistance if you have had your employment terminated to determine your rights and potential remedies, if any.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Know Your Employee Rights", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Letting Go Of Employees > Retrenched in Singapore? Know Your Employee Rights", "text": "Retrenched in Singapore? Know Your Employee Rights\nLast updated on March 5, 2025\nIn 2024, major tech companies like Meta, TikTok, Dyson, Microsoft, and Google collectively laid off an estimated\nat least 9,000 employees\nin Singapore, covering sectors such as social media, electronics, cloud, gaming, and AI content moderation. The slowdown in economy and fall in profitability are often cited as reasons for workforce reductions.\nSingapore, being an open economy, is highly exposed to such fluctuations in the global economy. As businesses adjust their operations, some employees will be affected.\nLosing your job can be a traumatic experience and dealing with the emotional fallout of a job loss can be difficult. During a company’s retrenchment exercise, employers have obligations while employees have certain rights.\nThis article aims to help you, an employee, understand what those rights and obligations are and what you can do if those rights have been infringed. It will cover:\nWhat Does It Mean to be Retrenched, Laid-off or Made Redundant?\n“Retrenched”, “laid-off” or “made redundant”\nare all terms used to describe unemployment that are very similar and often used interchangeably.\nH\nowever, there are some differences between them. In all three circumstances, it is important to bear in mind that the employees are not at fault and the decision to retrench or lay off an employee is not a reflection of their performance.\nA layoff is when an employer temporarily terminates the employment of a work, usually due to a downturn in business or a lack of work. Employees may be rehired when business improves or when new work becomes available. During the laid-off period, employees are not paid a salary but are paid laid-off compensation.\nTemporary lay-offs do not terminate the employment relationship; in effect, the employment relationship is paused. The employer may recall the employee back at the specific date after which the employment relationship generally continues.\nA retrenchment, on the other hand, is a form of layoff which involves permanent termination of employment. Unlike layoffs which are generally used to reduce the workforce during business periods, retrenchment is a strategy to restructure the entire organisation and reduce corporate expenses.\nThis can happen in response to economic slowdown or as a result of merger or acquisition,\nincluding company takeovers in the case of Elon Musk and Twitter.\nRedundancy occurs when a specific role is no longer required because of operational change within a company. Reasons for operational change include installing new processes or equipment that replace a job currently performed by the employee or company restructuring due to economic downtrend. Once the position is made redundant, the employee holding that role can either be redeployed into another role or retrenched.\nFor example, if a business is in a downturn, the company may think about what skills are least needed now and make those positions redundant. This means reducing or eliminating positions that contribute the least to income, have skills that are the easiest to replace or have duties that are moved to other positions.\nWhat are My Legal Rights If I Have Been Retrenched in Singapore?\nCurrently, in Singapore, there is no overarching law that statutorily protects retrenched workers. The benefits upon retrenchment depend on the company’s policy of severance package and retrenchment benefits as well as your terms of contract of employment.\nThe terms in the employment contract outline the details of the employment agreement and are binding on you and your employer. The employment contract should therefore be the first recourse for an affected employee, followed by the company’s internal policies or other regulations.\nTerms of your retrenchment benefits\nWho is eligible for retrenchment benefits?\nAccording to the\nEmployment Act (EA),\nan employee who has been in continuous service with an employer for at least 2 years is entitled to retrenchment benefits on his or her dismissal.\nHowever, employers may provide employees with less than 2 years’ service retrenchment benefit out of goodwill, as an ex gratia payment.\nIn February 2025,\nPropertyGuru laid off 174 employees\nafter shutting down its home service platform Sendhelper, mortgage broker service PropertyGuru Finance, and its data and software solutions department. The affected employees will receive a severance package of one month’s salary for each year of service (capped at 12 months), along with an ex gratia payment equivalent to one month’s salary.\nIt is important to note that the EA only governs employees working under a contract of service, regardless of whether the employee is a local or foreign employee.\nThe EA does not cover employees who work less than 35 hours a week. Instead, these are part-time employees covered by the\nEmployment of Part-Time Employees Regulations\n. Self-employed persons, seafarers, domestic workers and statutory board employees are also not covered by the EA.\nInstead, their employment terms will be set out in their employment contract.\nFor more information, you may refer to our other article on\nwho is covered by the EA\n.\nWhat is the amount payable for retrenchment benefits?\nThe EA does not specify the quantum of retrenchment benefits. Therefore, the amount would likely depend on the company policy and terms of the employment contract.\nThe\nTripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Entrenchment\n(referred to as the “Advisory” in this article) urges companies to pay employees retrenchment benefits of 2 weeks to 1 month’s salary per year of service. The exact amount will vary depending on the financial position of the company and industry practices.\nThe advisory is not legally binding on the employers but it sets out fair work practices that the employer is highly encouraged to abide by.\nIn the event a legal proceeding is commenced,\nthese objective guidelines help to establish a fair standard when assessing liability.\nWhat if I’m not paid any retrenchment benefits or wish to dispute my retrenchment benefit?\nIf your company fails to pay out your retrenchment benefit\no\nr if you are disputing the amount of benefit, you may opt to file a salary-related claim or undergo mediation at the\nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management\n(TADM).\nGenerally, retrenchment claims cannot be heard at the Employment Claims Tribunal because providing retrenchment benefits is not compulsory under the EA.\nHowever, if your employment contract or collective agreement provides for retrenchment benefits, you may consider escalating the claim further to the Tribunal if the issue cannot be settled between you and your employer. The Tribunal holds the authority to make orders against the employer to pay the deserved retrenchment benefit and order costs. More information regarding the Employment Claims Tribunal can be found\nhere\n.\nIf your company is undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, judicial management or liquidation, you cannot file a salary-related claim with TADM. Instead, you should file a claim directly with the Insolvency Office or the appointed judicial manager or liquidator of the company.\nIt would be advisable to consult a lawyer on the possible avenues for legal recourse, which may differ from case to case.\nServing notice for retrenchment\nEmployers should inform employees about an upcoming retrenchment exercise as well as the reasons for it.\nEmployers are also legally required to serve notice to employees according to the terms of the employment contract or, in the absence of such provision, the notice period must be in accordance with the EA (provided the employee is covered by the EA).\nThe period of service and the corresponding notice period required is illustrated in the table below.\nLength of Service\nNotice Period\nShorter than 26 weeks\n1 day\n26 weeks to shorter than 2 years\n1 week\n2 years to shorter than 5 years\n2 weeks\n5 years and above\n4 weeks\nYou may wish to request for a longer notice period than what is legally required so that you have sufficient time to help facilitate your transition to a new role or make alternative employment arrangements.\nMedical benefits\nEmployers are not legally bound to help employees maintain their\ne\nxisting medical benefits. However, responsible employers should restructure existing medical benefits and provide additional MediSave contributions or other flexible benefits. These payouts will contribute to the employee’s MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plan premiums (if applicable).\nIn the PropertyGuru layoff exercise, affected employees were offered additional support, including three months of extended medical insurance, career and job search assistance, and up to three months of unpaid leave for those facing visa, relocation, or financial challenges. They were also provided with repatriation assistance and help with the early termination of rental leases.\nMaternity benefits\nIf an employee is pregnant during retrenchment, she is entitled to maternity leave benefits if she meets the eligibility criteria under the EA or Child Development Co-Savings Act. This payment will be in addition to her retrenchment benefits.\nUnder the Child Development Co-Savings Act, a working mother will be entitled to 16 weeks of Government-Paid Maternity Leave commensurate with her usual monthly salary during the leave period.\nYour eligibility depends on the following criteria:\nYour child is a Singaporean citizen\nYou are legally married to the child’s father\nYour child is born or has estimated delivery date on or after 1 January 2017\nYou have worked for your employer or have been self-employed for at least 3 continuous months before the birth of your child\nLeave applications and reimbursement claims can be applied through the\nGovernment-Paid Leave Portal\n.\nShares/Restricted stock units (RSUs)\nRSUs are company shares issued to be vested to the employees according to a schedule. Stocks are granted typically after the employee has fulfilled a certain length of employment or hit performance. Afterwards, these stocks can then be freely transferred and sold.\nIn Singapore, RSUs are a matter of contract between the employer and the employee and are not governed by any legislation. Companies would commonly allow retrenched employees to keep any vested incentive awards while unvested awards lapse. In most responsible retrenchment, the norm would be to allow shares that mature in the next 3 months to be vested or pay a prorated sum as an ex gratia payment.\nWhat If I’m Aged 63 and Above, and Have Been Retrenched?\nAccording to the\nRetirement and Re-employment Act\n(RRA), the minimum retirement age in Singapore is 63 years. Under Singapore’s laws, employers are obligated to offer workers above 63 years of age re-employment until the age of 68.\nHowever, if your employer cannot find a suitable job for you within the organisation, they can offer you an\nEmployment Assistance Payment\n(EAP) as per\nthe Tripartite Guidelines for Re-employment of Older Workers\n.\nThe EAP is a one-off payment equivalent to 3.5 months’ salary, subject to a minimum of S$6,250 to a maximum of S$14,750. For a senior employee that has been re-employed for at least 30 months since turning 63, a lower EAP amount of 2 months of salary could be considered, subject to a minimum of $4,000 and a maximum of $8,500.\nWhat If I Had Relocated to Singapore and was Subsequently Retrenched?\nWhether or not your company will provide you with retrenchment benefits is discretionary and dependent on your company’s relocation policies as well as the terms of your employment contract.\nIf a foreign employee who was issued an S pass, employment pass or personalised employment pass is repatriated, the employer is liable for the repatriation costs unless the pass holder had contractually agreed to pay for such costs.\nRetrenchment is a different situation from\nhaving your job offer rescinded\nbefore you even started employment.\nWhat Does It Mean For My Company to Carry Out Retrenchment “Responsibly”?\nThe Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) provides the Advisory and general guidelines for responsible retrenchment such as notifying affected employees as soon as possible, providing the reasons for retrenchment and communicating openly and compassionately with employees.\nTAFEP issued the\nAdvisory\nfor employers to fairly and compassionately carry out the retrenchment process. The Advisory encourages employers to consult the unions, consider alternative solutions and provide support to retrenched employees.\nIn January 2024,\nLazada conducted a retrenchment exercise\nwithout consulting the union, sparking frustration among employees. Initially, those affected were offered two weeks’ salary for each year of service, a package that many found insufficient. After negotiations with the Food, Drinks, and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU), some workers were given an additional two weeks’ salary, while others a S$1,200 support package. However, the additional salary was mostly offered to junior employees, while higher-ranking staff received the S$1,200 payout, which represented less than 10% of their typical monthly salary. Despite the improved terms, many employees remained dissatisfied, feeling that the compensation did not reflect their contributions. The union and Lazada’’s handling of the retrenchment left employees feeling disillusioned, and it was seen as a poor example for other companies facing similar situations.\nYou may refer to\nthis\npage for more on TAFEP’s guidelines.\n—\nDuring retrenchment, employees should refer to their employment contract for the details of their severance packages. The notice period would also give them a preparation runway for the next step.\nIf any of your legal rights are infringed or certain employer’s obligations are not adhered to, you can consult an\nemployment lawyer in Singapore\nfor further assistance to better ascertain your legal rights.\nAlternatively, you may consult the\nMinistry of Manpower\nor TAFEP for lodging a claim and mediating retrenchment benefit disputes.\nFor further emotional support in navigating retrenchment,\nMy Careers Future\nhas collated some resources on how to manage negative emotions and plan ahead.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

For a senior employee that has been re-employed for at least 30 months since turning 63, a lower EAP amount of 2 months of salary could be considered, subject to a minimum of $4,000 and a maximum of $8,500.\nWhat If I Had Relocated to Singapore and was Subsequently Retrenched?\nWhether or not your company will provide you with retrenchment benefits is discretionary and dependent on your company’s relocation policies as well as the terms of your employment contract.\nIf a foreign employee who was issued an S pass, employment pass or personalised employment pass is repatriated, the employer is liable for the repatriation costs unless the pass holder had contractually agreed to pay for such costs.\nRetrenchment is a different situation from\nhaving your job offer rescinded\nbefore you even started employment.\nWhat Does It Mean For My Company to Carry Out Retrenchment “Responsibly”?\nThe Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) provides the Advisory and general guidelines for responsible retrenchment such as notifying affected employees as soon as possible, providing the reasons for retrenchment and communicating openly and compassionately with employees.\nTAFEP issued the\nAdvisory\nfor employers to fairly and compassionately carry out the retrenchment process. The Advisory encourages employers to consult the unions, consider alternative solutions and provide support to retrenched employees.\nIn January 2024,\nLazada conducted a retrenchment exercise\nwithout consulting the union, sparking frustration among employees. Initially, those affected were offered two weeks’ salary for each year of service, a package that many found insufficient. After negotiations with the Food, Drinks, and Allied Workers Union (FDAWU), some workers were given an additional two weeks’ salary, while others a S$1,200 support package. However, the additional salary was mostly offered to junior employees, while higher-ranking staff received the S$1,200 payout, which represented less than 10% of their typical monthly salary. Despite the improved terms, many employees remained dissatisfied, feeling that the compensation did not reflect their contributions. The union and Lazada’’s handling of the retrenchment left employees feeling disillusioned, and it was seen as a poor example for other companies facing similar situations.\nYou may refer to\nthis\npage for more on TAFEP’s guidelines.\n—\nDuring retrenchment, employees should refer to their employment contract for the details of their severance packages. The notice period would also give them a preparation runway for the next step.\nIf any of your legal rights are infringed or certain employer’s obligations are not adhered to, you can consult an\nemployment lawyer in Singapore\nfor further assistance to better ascertain your legal rights.\nAlternatively, you may consult the\nMinistry of Manpower\nor TAFEP for lodging a claim and mediating retrenchment benefit disputes.\nFor further emotional support in navigating retrenchment,\nMy Careers Future\nhas collated some resources on how to manage negative emotions and plan ahead.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Several high-profile closures, such as Twelve Cupcakes, Jollibean, and Art Works, have brought these issues into the spotlight, highlighting the legal and financial uncertainty sudden closures can cause.\nThis article explains the legal remedies and avenues of recourse available to affected employees under Singapore law, the obligations employers owe when they cease operations, and the practical steps employees can take to protect their rights. The article will cover the following topics:\n​Is There a Legal Framework Governing the Sudden Closure of a Business?\nUnder Singapore law, there is no specific statute or legal framework dealing solely with sudden business closures. However, the closest legal framework is the one governing retrenchment, which sets out employers’ obligations when terminating employees due to business downturns or restructuring. This legal framework comes from the Employment Act (EA) as well as the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment (Tripartite Advisory). The Tripartite Advisory is issued by the tripartite partners – the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF).\nIn Singapore, “retrenchment” refers to when an employee is dismissed on the ground of redundancy (i.e. when your specific role is no longer required because your employer is reducing its workforce) or by reason of the employer’s reorganisation of its business (e.g. by merging with other companies, or if it decides to exit a certain market). In contrast, where employees are dismissed for misconduct or performance issues, that would not count as retrenchment.\nThe legal framework for retrenchment applies to both permanent employees, as well as contract workers with employment contracts of at least 6 months.\n​What are the Obligations on the Part of an Employer During Retrenchment?\nDuring a retrenchment exercise, employers have the following obligations:\nObjective Selection Criteria\n: Employers must be objective in their selection of employees for retrenchment. This means that the selection must be based on objective criteria like the employee’s ability, experience and skills to support the company’s business needs. For example, employers cannot select employees for retrenchment based solely on their age, e.g. retrenching only older employees instead of younger ones.\nEarly and Clear Communication to Employees\n: Employers should inform employees early of their intention to retrench and the employers’ efforts to manage business challenges. Employers should also outline how the retrenchment exercise will be carried out, explain the selection criteria that will be considered and specify what kind of assistance is available to affected employees. This communication should come even before serving the retrenchment notices on the individual employees. This is so that employees can be prepared for the possibility that they may be retrenched.\nMandatory Retrenchment Notifications to MOM\n: Employers who have businesses registered in Singapore and at least 10 employees must notify MOM of the retrenchments within 5 working days after notifying affected employees of their retrenchments. The rationale behind requiring employers to notify MOM of retrenchments is so that the relevant agencies (including Workforce Singapore (WSG), NTUC, SNEF etc.) can assist affected employees with finding alternative employment or identifying training/upskilling programmes that affected employees can undertake to enhance their employability.\nPayment of Retrenchment Benefits\n: Employers must also pay a retrenchment benefit to employees who have been in continuous service with the employer for 2 years or more.\nYou can refer to our other article on\nRetrenchment in Singapore: Employer Obligations\nfor a more detailed discussion on this topic.\n​What Rights Does an Employee Have During a Retrenchment?\nAs mentioned above, employees who have worked with their employer continuously for at least 2 years are legally entitled to be paid retrenchment benefits. However, the amount of retrenchment benefit is not fixed by statute. Instead, this depends on what is stated in the employment agreements between the employers and employees, including in the employment contract. If there is no clause providing for the amount of retrenchment benefit to be paid, the amount is to be negotiated between the employers and the employees (or through their union, if the company is a unionised company).\nYou can refer to our other article on\nRetrenched in Singapore? Know Your Employee Rights\nfor a more detailed overview.\nIn cases where the business abruptly shutters, as compared to retrenchments, there may be other considerations or rights that employers might owe employees which will be discussed further in the sections below.\n​What are an Employee’s Rights/Entitlements in a Business Closure Scenario?\nWhen a business closes unexpectedly, the main issues that can arise revolve around unpaid employment entitlements and claims in insolvency against the company.\n​Payment of final salaries to employees\nUnder the EA, upon the dismissal of an employee, the employer must pay the total salary and any sum due to the employee within 3 working days after the employee’s dismissal. This obligation would apply even in the case of a sudden business closure, such that employers must pay all final salaries to their employees.\nIf the business closes in the middle of the month, and employees are paid on a monthly basis, the final salaries of the employees should be pro-rated, i.e. calculated using the following formula: (\nMonthly gross rate of pay\n/\nNumber of days on which the employee is required to work that month\n) x (\nNumber of days the employee actually worked that month\n).\nFor example, an employee is paid a monthly salary of $5,000 on the last day of each month, and the employee is required to work 20 days a month. The business closes in the middle of the month, and the employee has only worked 10 days that month. The employer would have to pay a final salary of $2,500 to the employee, calculated as follows: ($5,000 / 20 days) x 10 days = $2,500.\n​Employees’ unused paid annual leave and bonuses\nIf upon a sudden business closure, employees still have unused paid annual leave, under the EA, employers must pay employees their gross rate of pay for every day of the employees’ unused paid annual leave. For example, if an employee has 8 days of paid annual leave remaining at the time of the business closure, then the employer has to pay said employee 8 days’ worth of salary.\nIf employees have accrued bonuses (e.g. performance bonuses or 13th month bonuses), which have been declared by the employers but have not been paid at the time of the business closure, the employer must also pay such bonuses to the employees.\n​Priority in insolvency proceedings\nUnder the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (IRDA), if a company is insolvent or enters liquidation, and the employer still owes monies (e.g. unpaid salaries, retrenchment benefits, CPF contributions) to their employees, the employees would have the status of preferential creditors of the company. This means that the employees are entitled to receive payments in priority as compared to ordinary creditors (e.g. other unsecured creditors such as unpaid contractors who did work for the company, suppliers, etc.).\nEmployees rank as preferential creditors for the following claims:\nUp to 5 months’ salary (capped at S$13,000)\nAccrued but unpaid retrenchment benefits\nUnpaid CPF contributions due to the CPF Board\nAfter these preferential claims, any remaining amounts (like bonuses or allowances) rank as unsecured and are paid only after preferential creditors, and together with other ordinary creditors.\nTo recover these sums, employees must file a proof of debt with the appointed liquidator, documenting outstanding amounts (pay slips, contracts, email correspondence, etc.). Employees can file a proof of debt electronically at the\nMinistry of Law, Insolvency Office’s website\n.\nWhile employees enjoy preferential status, one thing to note is that full recovery of the sums due is not always guaranteed. Ultimately, whether and how much employees will be able to get during the liquidation process depends on whether the company still has sufficient assets which can be used to satisfy the claims. For example, the liquidator will typically try to sell the company’s existing assets (e.g. movable property like furniture, art pieces etc., or even immovable property like office spaces) and distribute the proceeds to creditors. If the company’s assets are insufficient to satisfy all the claims against the company, employees may end up receiving only partial payment, or potentially even nothing at all.\nTo illustrate how sudden business closures interact with insolvency proceedings, we will briefly discuss the closure of the confectionery chain, Twelve Cupcakes. In October 2025, Twelve Cupcakes abruptly ceased operations and was placed under liquidation. The sudden closure affected about 80 employees, who were owed unpaid salaries. Liquidators were appointed to control the business and the company’s assets in the liquidation. Apart from the unpaid salaries owed to the 80 employees, Twelve Cupcakes also owed slightly over $1 million to around 100 other creditors, including suppliers, such as Phoon Huat, as well as packaging companies. In line with the preferential status accorded to employees, and subject to any recovery of the company’s assets, the liquidators expect to distribute the unpaid salaries of the 80 affected employees first before distributing the remaining to the other creditors.\n​Can the Business Owners/Directors be Held Liable for a Sudden Closure?\nWhen a business abruptly shuts its doors, employees often ask whether those in charge (e.g. the company’s directors or owners) can be personally held responsible for unpaid salaries or other entitlements. Generally, Singapore law respects the principle of a separate legal personality for corporate entities. What this means is that the company itself, and not its owners or directors, is liable for the company’s debts. However, in some situations, the company’s directors or owners can be held liable for the consequences of the sudden closure.\n​Personal liability\nUnder the EA and Central Provident Fund Act (CPF Act), employers have a legal duty to pay employees’ salaries within prescribed timelines and to make monthly CPF contributions. A business closure does not extinguish these obligations. Where such salaries or CPF contributions remain outstanding, officers or directors responsible for managing the company can face criminal liability if it can be shown that they wilfully or negligently failed to ensure payment:\nEA\n: An employer’s failure to pay employees’ salaries is an offence. Upon conviction, employers may be liable for fines between $3,000 and $15,000 per charge, a maximum imprisonment term of 6 months or to both. Repeat offenders face double the penalties. Directors or other officers of the company may be held personally liable for the offence if they were involved in, or consented to, the company’s failure to comply with the regulations.\nCPF Act\n: Employers who fail to pay CPF contributions may be liable upon conviction for a maximum fine of $10,000, a maximum imprisonment term of 7 years, or to both. Directors or other officers of the company may also be held personally liable for the offence if they were involved in, or consented to, the company’s failure to comply with the regulations.\nThere are cases where directors have been held liable for their companies’ default. For example, in 2021, Twelve Cupcakes was charged for the underpayment of foreign workers’ salaries under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. The company was fined $119,500 after being convicted of multiple counts of the offence. The two founding directors of Twelve Cupcakes were also charged with allowing the company to underpay the wages of their foreign employees. They were convicted of the charges, and fined $65,000 each.\n​Piercing the corporate veil or parent company liability\nIf the company that closes suddenly is a subsidiary of another parent company, or a parent company group, this raises further issues in terms of who can be held liable for the company’s debts. As mentioned above, Singapore law generally upholds the principle of separate legal personality. This extends to subsidiary companies as well. For example, company A, which is a subsidiary of company B, would be considered a separate legal entity from company B, even if company B wholly owns company A. It also does not matter if the two companies are located in different countries – if company A is in Singapore while company B is located overseas, as both companies would still be viewed as separate legal entities.\nIn certain exceptional and rare circumstances, the court may “pierce the corporate veil” to hold the parent company (e.g. company B in the above example) for the debts of the subsidiary company (e.g. company A). By “piercing the corporate veil”, this means that the court disregards the separate legal status of the two companies and treats them as one entity to hold them liable. Examples where the court will do this include: if company B is using company A to evade its own legal obligations or to commit fraud, the court may then look to company B to fulfil company A’s obligations. Likewise, where company A is a sham or façade, i.e. company B is just using company A as an extension to conduct its business and does not distinguish between the two businesses, the court may also hold company B responsible for company A’s obligations.\n​Foreign directors\nForeign nationals serving as directors are also bound by the same legal duties. However, enforcing against foreign directors can be more challenging since they can leave Singapore at any time, and employees may find themselves without recourse, especially if the company has no recoverable assets. In such a situation, employees can consider the following options:\nFiling police or MOM complaints to trigger investigations and possible prosecution against these foreign directors. This may have the effect of pressuring them to fulfil their legal duties.\nSeeking legal advice on possible cross-border enforcement or freezing orders against the foreign directors, especially if their assets are based, or have been moved overseas. However, do note that the process of recovery across borders is likely to be costly, time-consuming and complex.\n​Practical Guidance/Advice for Affected Employees\nIf you find yourself unemployed after a sudden business closure, taking immediate and informed action is crucial. Below is a structured checklist to help protect your rights and maximise your chances of recovery.\n​Step 1: Document everything\nGather and preserve all evidence of your employment and payment history. This includes:\nEmployment or appointment letters\nPayslips and bank transaction records\nCPF statements\nEmail correspondence and internal notices about closure or payment delays\nSuch records will be vital for substantiating claims to the liquidator, enforcement agencies, or the courts.\n​Step 2: Register your claim as a creditor and understand your creditor status\nOnce a liquidator is appointed, contact their office to file a proof of debt.  This form typically requires details of the amount owed, the nature of the claim (salary, leave, etc.), and supporting documents. While there is no guarantee of full recovery, creditors who file promptly and accurately stand a better chance of receiving their claims when assets are realised.\nAs an employee, you will rank as a preferential creditor, so your claims for unpaid salary, retrenchment benefits and unpaid CPF contributions will be paid out ahead of other ordinary creditors.\n​Step 3: Seek legal advice if misconduct is suspected\nIf you suspect that the company directors have acted dishonestly or fraudulently, you may also wish to consult a lawyer who can advise you on potential legal actions that you may pursue against the directors, such as civil claims for breach of fiduciary duty, or to file a complaint leading to a criminal investigation. Lawyers can also advise on cross-border claims, especially if the business owners or assets have been moved overseas.\n​Step 4: Collaborate through unions and seek help from government agencies\nIf your company is a unionised company, you should immediately contact your union or the NTUC for assistance in collective negotiations or structured mediation.\nOther agencies like the Workforce Singapore (WSG) and Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) can also provide career transition services, financial support schemes to tide you over until you manage to secure another job, and retraining opportunities to help you upskill and expand your career options.\nYou can also reach out to the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), which can assist you with filing your proof of debt for your salary or other employment claims with the liquidator. TADM would also be able to assist you with your unpaid salary claims either through mediation (involving the company) or by referring your case to the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT). More generally, if you just require some advice on your employment dispute, you can also reach out to TADM for such advice.\n​Proactive and preventive measures\nWhile it may be difficult to foresee sudden business closures, there are practical precautions that you can take to mitigate the risks when such a situation occurs:\nRead and understand your employment contract. You should ensure that the terms in your employment contract on notice periods, retrenchment benefits, and salary payment are clearly stated in writing. If necessary, you can consult an employment lawyer on the terms of your employment contract.\nStay alert to red flags such as consistent late salary payments, withheld commissions, unfiled CPF contributions, or persistent vendor complaints. You should also keep records of these red flags which relate to you (e.g. late salary payments) as much as you can (e.g. file the relevant emails), as they may be useful later.\nRaise concerns early to your HR department, MOM, or union representatives if payment obligations are consistently breached.\nMaintain updated personal savings and emergency funds, as even preferential creditors may not recover full sums if the company’s assets are exhausted.\n—\nWhen an employer closes abruptly, employees face both emotional and financial uncertainty. Singapore’s legal framework, while grounded in the principle of limited liability, provides several enforcement routes for recovering wages, addressing misconduct by directors, and asserting priority as preferential creditors in liquidation.\nDirectors who wilfully fail to pay their employees’ salaries and/or CPF contributions can be held personally liable. On the other hand, employees can protect themselves through timely documentation, filing proofs of debt with the company if necessary, and by seeking timely assistance.\nIf you have been affected by a sudden business closure, you can contact MOM or TADM, for assistance. You may also approach support networks such as WSG, NTUC, or TAFEP for career and financial help while exploring legal remedies. At the same time, you may also wish to\nseek further legal advice or guidance from an employment lawyer\n, who will be able to advise you on potential claims that you can make against your employer or the company directors, and represent you in such legal actions.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Several high-profile closures, such as Twelve Cupcakes, Jollibean, and Art Works, have brought these issues into the spotlight, highlighting the legal and financial uncertainty sudden closures can cause.\nThis article explains the legal remedies and avenues of recourse available to affected employees under Singapore law, the obligations employers owe when they cease operations, and the practical steps employees can take to protect their rights. The article will cover the following topics:\n​Is There a Legal Framework Governing the Sudden Closure of a Business?\nUnder Singapore law, there is no specific statute or legal framework dealing solely with sudden business closures. However, the closest legal framework is the one governing retrenchment, which sets out employers’ obligations when terminating employees due to business downturns or restructuring. This legal framework comes from the Employment Act (EA) as well as the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment (Tripartite Advisory). The Tripartite Advisory is issued by the tripartite partners – the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF).\nIn Singapore, “retrenchment” refers to when an employee is dismissed on the ground of redundancy (i.e. when your specific role is no longer required because your employer is reducing its workforce) or by reason of the employer’s reorganisation of its business (e.g. by merging with other companies, or if it decides to exit a certain market). In contrast, where employees are dismissed for misconduct or performance issues, that would not count as retrenchment.\nThe legal framework for retrenchment applies to both permanent employees, as well as contract workers with employment contracts of at least 6 months.\n​What are the Obligations on the Part of an Employer During Retrenchment?\nDuring a retrenchment exercise, employers have the following obligations:\nObjective Selection Criteria\n: Employers must be objective in their selection of employees for retrenchment. This means that the selection must be based on objective criteria like the employee’s ability, experience and skills to support the company’s business needs. For example, employers cannot select employees for retrenchment based solely on their age, e.g. retrenching only older employees instead of younger ones.\nEarly and Clear Communication to Employees\n: Employers should inform employees early of their intention to retrench and the employers’ efforts to manage business challenges. Employers should also outline how the retrenchment exercise will be carried out, explain the selection criteria that will be considered and specify what kind of assistance is available to affected employees. This communication should come even before serving the retrenchment notices on the individual employees. This is so that employees can be prepared for the possibility that they may be retrenched.\nMandatory Retrenchment Notifications to MOM\n: Employers who have businesses registered in Singapore and at least 10 employees must notify MOM of the retrenchments within 5 working days after notifying affected employees of their retrenchments. The rationale behind requiring employers to notify MOM of retrenchments is so that the relevant agencies (including Workforce Singapore (WSG), NTUC, SNEF etc.) can assist affected employees with finding alternative employment or identifying training/upskilling programmes that affected employees can undertake to enhance their employability.\nPayment of Retrenchment Benefits\n: Employers must also pay a retrenchment benefit to employees who have been in continuous service with the employer for 2 years or more.\nYou can refer to our other article on\nRetrenchment in Singapore: Employer Obligations\nfor a more detailed discussion on this topic.\n​What Rights Does an Employee Have During a Retrenchment?\nAs mentioned above, employees who have worked with their employer continuously for at least 2 years are legally entitled to be paid retrenchment benefits. However, the amount of retrenchment benefit is not fixed by statute. Instead, this depends on what is stated in the employment agreements between the employers and employees, including in the employment contract. If there is no clause providing for the amount of retrenchment benefit to be paid, the amount is to be negotiated between the employers and the employees (or through their union, if the company is a unionised company).\nYou can refer to our other article on\nRetrenched in Singapore? Know Your Employee Rights\nfor a more detailed overview.\nIn cases where the business abruptly shutters, as compared to retrenchments, there may be other considerations or rights that employers might owe employees which will be discussed further in the sections below.\n​What are an Employee’s Rights/Entitlements in a Business Closure Scenario?\nWhen a business closes unexpectedly, the main issues that can arise revolve around unpaid employment entitlements and claims in insolvency against the company.\n​Payment of final salaries to employees\nUnder the EA, upon the dismissal of an employee, the employer must pay the total salary and any sum due to the employee within 3 working days after the employee’s dismissal. This obligation would apply even in the case of a sudden business closure, such that employers must pay all final salaries to their employees.\nIf the business closes in the middle of the month, and employees are paid on a monthly basis, the final salaries of the employees should be pro-rated, i.e. calculated using the following formula: (\nMonthly gross rate of pay\n/\nNumber of days on which the employee is required to work that month\n) x (\nNumber of days the employee actually worked that month\n).\nFor example, an employee is paid a monthly salary of $5,000 on the last day of each month, and the employee is required to work 20 days a month. The business closes in the middle of the month, and the employee has only worked 10 days that month. The employer would have to pay a final salary of $2,500 to the employee, calculated as follows: ($5,000 / 20 days) x 10 days = $2,500.\n​Employees’ unused paid annual leave and bonuses\nIf upon a sudden business closure, employees still have unused paid annual leave, under the EA, employers must pay employees their gross rate of pay for every day of the employees’ unused paid annual leave. For example, if an employee has 8 days of paid annual leave remaining at the time of the business closure, then the employer has to pay said employee 8 days’ worth of salary.\nIf employees have accrued bonuses (e.g. performance bonuses or 13th month bonuses), which have been declared by the employers but have not been paid at the time of the business closure, the employer must also pay such bonuses to the employees.\n​Priority in insolvency proceedings\nUnder the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (IRDA), if a company is insolvent or enters liquidation, and the employer still owes monies (e.g. unpaid salaries, retrenchment benefits, CPF contributions) to their employees, the employees would have the status of preferential creditors of the company. This means that the employees are entitled to receive payments in priority as compared to ordinary creditors (e.g. other unsecured creditors such as unpaid contractors who did work for the company, suppliers, etc.).\nEmployees rank as preferential creditors for the following claims:\nUp to 5 months’ salary (capped at S$13,000)\nAccrued but unpaid retrenchment benefits\nUnpaid CPF contributions due to the CPF Board\nAfter these preferential claims, any remaining amounts (like bonuses or allowances) rank as unsecured and are paid only after preferential creditors, and together with other ordinary creditors.\nTo recover these sums, employees must file a proof of debt with the appointed liquidator, documenting outstanding amounts (pay slips, contracts, email correspondence, etc.). Employees can file a proof of debt electronically at the\nMinistry of Law, Insolvency Office’s website\n.\nWhile employees enjoy preferential status, one thing to note is that full recovery of the sums due is not always guaranteed. Ultimately, whether and how much employees will be able to get during the liquidation process depends on whether the company still has sufficient assets which can be used to satisfy the claims. For example, the liquidator will typically try to sell the company’s existing assets (e.g. movable property like furniture, art pieces etc., or even immovable property like office spaces) and distribute the proceeds to creditors. If the company’s assets are insufficient to satisfy all the claims against the company, employees may end up receiving only partial payment, or potentially even nothing at all.\nTo illustrate how sudden business closures interact with insolvency proceedings, we will briefly discuss the closure of the confectionery chain, Twelve Cupcakes. In October 2025, Twelve Cupcakes abruptly ceased operations and was placed under liquidation. The sudden closure affected about 80 employees, who were owed unpaid salaries. Liquidators were appointed to control the business and the company’s assets in the liquidation. Apart from the unpaid salaries owed to the 80 employees, Twelve Cupcakes also owed slightly over $1 million to around 100 other creditors, including suppliers, such as Phoon Huat, as well as packaging companies. In line with the preferential status accorded to employees, and subject to any recovery of the company’s assets, the liquidators expect to distribute the unpaid salaries of the 80 affected employees first before distributing the remaining to the other creditors.\n​Can the Business Owners/Directors be Held Liable for a Sudden Closure?\nWhen a business abruptly shuts its doors, employees often ask whether those in charge (e.g. the company’s directors or owners) can be personally held responsible for unpaid salaries or other entitlements. Generally, Singapore law respects the principle of a separate legal personality for corporate entities. What this means is that the company itself, and not its owners or directors, is liable for the company’s debts. However, in some situations, the company’s directors or owners can be held liable for the consequences of the sudden closure.\n​Personal liability\nUnder the EA and Central Provident Fund Act (CPF Act), employers have a legal duty to pay employees’ salaries within prescribed timelines and to make monthly CPF contributions. A business closure does not extinguish these obligations. Where such salaries or CPF contributions remain outstanding, officers or directors responsible for managing the company can face criminal liability if it can be shown that they wilfully or negligently failed to ensure payment:\nEA\n: An employer’s failure to pay employees’ salaries is an offence. Upon conviction, employers may be liable for fines between $3,000 and $15,000 per charge, a maximum imprisonment term of 6 months or to both. Repeat offenders face double the penalties. Directors or other officers of the company may be held personally liable for the offence if they were involved in, or consented to, the company’s failure to comply with the regulations.\nCPF Act\n: Employers who fail to pay CPF contributions may be liable upon conviction for a maximum fine of $10,000, a maximum imprisonment term of 7 years, or to both. Directors or other officers of the company may also be held personally liable for the offence if they were involved in, or consented to, the company’s failure to comply with the regulations.\nThere are cases where directors have been held liable for their companies’ default. For example, in 2021, Twelve Cupcakes was charged for the underpayment of foreign workers’ salaries under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. The company was fined $119,500 after being convicted of multiple counts of the offence. The two founding directors of Twelve Cupcakes were also charged with allowing the company to underpay the wages of their foreign employees. They were convicted of the charges, and fined $65,000 each.\n​Piercing the corporate veil or parent company liability\nIf the company that closes suddenly is a subsidiary of another parent company, or a parent company group, this raises further issues in terms of who can be held liable for the company’s debts. As mentioned above, Singapore law generally upholds the principle of separate legal personality. This extends to subsidiary companies as well. For example, company A, which is a subsidiary of company B, would be considered a separate legal entity from company B, even if company B wholly owns company A. It also does not matter if the two companies are located in different countries – if company A is in Singapore while company B is located overseas, as both companies would still be viewed as separate legal entities.\nIn certain exceptional and rare circumstances, the court may “pierce the corporate veil” to hold the parent company (e.g. company B in the above example) for the debts of the subsidiary company (e.g. company A). By “piercing the corporate veil”, this means that the court disregards the separate legal status of the two companies and treats them as one entity to hold them liable. Examples where the court will do this include: if company B is using company A to evade its own legal obligations or to commit fraud, the court may then look to company B to fulfil company A’s obligations. Likewise, where company A is a sham or façade, i.e. company B is just using company A as an extension to conduct its business and does not distinguish between the two businesses, the court may also hold company B responsible for company A’s obligations.\n​Foreign directors\nForeign nationals serving as directors are also bound by the same legal duties. However, enforcing against foreign directors can be more challenging since they can leave Singapore at any time, and employees may find themselves without recourse, especially if the company has no recoverable assets. In such a situation, employees can consider the following options:\nFiling police or MOM complaints to trigger investigations and possible prosecution against these foreign directors. This may have the effect of pressuring them to fulfil their legal duties.\nSeeking legal advice on possible cross-border enforcement or freezing orders against the foreign directors, especially if their assets are based, or have been moved overseas. However, do note that the process of recovery across borders is likely to be costly, time-consuming and complex.\n​Practical Guidance/Advice for Affected Employees\nIf you find yourself unemployed after a sudden business closure, taking immediate and informed action is crucial. Below is a structured checklist to help protect your rights and maximise your chances of recovery.\n​Step 1: Document everything\nGather and preserve all evidence of your employment and payment history. This includes:\nEmployment or appointment letters\nPayslips and bank transaction records\nCPF statements\nEmail correspondence and internal notices about closure or payment delays\nSuch records will be vital for substantiating claims to the liquidator, enforcement agencies, or the courts.\n​Step 2: Register your claim as a creditor and understand your creditor status\nOnce a liquidator is appointed, contact their office to file a proof of debt.  This form typically requires details of the amount owed, the nature of the claim (salary, leave, etc.), and supporting documents. While there is no guarantee of full recovery, creditors who file promptly and accurately stand a better chance of receiving their claims when assets are realised.\nAs an employee, you will rank as a preferential creditor, so your claims for unpaid salary, retrenchment benefits and unpaid CPF contributions will be paid out ahead of other ordinary creditors.\n​Step 3: Seek legal advice if misconduct is suspected\nIf you suspect that the company directors have acted dishonestly or fraudulently, you may also wish to consult a lawyer who can advise you on potential legal actions that you may pursue against the directors, such as civil claims for breach of fiduciary duty, or to file a complaint leading to a criminal investigation. Lawyers can also advise on cross-border claims, especially if the business owners or assets have been moved overseas.\n​Step 4: Collaborate through unions and seek help from government agencies\nIf your company is a unionised company, you should immediately contact your union or the NTUC for assistance in collective negotiations or structured mediation.\nOther agencies like the Workforce Singapore (WSG) and Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) can also provide career transition services, financial support schemes to tide you over until you manage to secure another job, and retraining opportunities to help you upskill and expand your career options.\nYou can also reach out to the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), which can assist you with filing your proof of debt for your salary or other employment claims with the liquidator. TADM would also be able to assist you with your unpaid salary claims either through mediation (involving the company) or by referring your case to the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT). More generally, if you just require some advice on your employment dispute, you can also reach out to TADM for such advice.\n​Proactive and preventive measures\nWhile it may be difficult to foresee sudden business closures, there are practical precautions that you can take to mitigate the risks when such a situation occurs:\nRead and understand your employment contract. You should ensure that the terms in your employment contract on notice periods, retrenchment benefits, and salary payment are clearly stated in writing. If necessary, you can consult an employment lawyer on the terms of your employment contract.\nStay alert to red flags such as consistent late salary payments, withheld commissions, unfiled CPF contributions, or persistent vendor complaints. You should also keep records of these red flags which relate to you (e.g. late salary payments) as much as you can (e.g. file the relevant emails), as they may be useful later.\nRaise concerns early to your HR department, MOM, or union representatives if payment obligations are consistently breached.\nMaintain updated personal savings and emergency funds, as even preferential creditors may not recover full sums if the company’s assets are exhausted.\n—\nWhen an employer closes abruptly, employees face both emotional and financial uncertainty. Singapore’s legal framework, while grounded in the principle of limited liability, provides several enforcement routes for recovering wages, addressing misconduct by directors, and asserting priority as preferential creditors in liquidation.\nDirectors who wilfully fail to pay their employees’ salaries and/or CPF contributions can be held personally liable. On the other hand, employees can protect themselves through timely documentation, filing proofs of debt with the company if necessary, and by seeking timely assistance.\nIf you have been affected by a sudden business closure, you can contact MOM or TADM, for assistance. You may also approach support networks such as WSG, NTUC, or TAFEP for career and financial help while exploring legal remedies. At the same time, you may also wish to\nseek further legal advice or guidance from an employment lawyer\n, who will be able to advise you on potential claims that you can make against your employer or the company directors, and represent you in such legal actions.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

{"chunk_id": "SLA_31f494da", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "Handling Employee Misconduct at the Workplace in Singapore", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employment Disputes > Handling Employee Misconduct at the Workplace in Singapore", "text": "Handling Employee Misconduct at the Workplace in Singapore\nLast updated on December 18, 2025\nEmployees may occasionally engage in behaviour constituting misconduct at the workplace. If their employers suspect them of having misconducted themselves, they may be tempted to let go of the employee in question. However, termination is a serious matter and would be premature where the misconduct is merely suspected and not proven yet.\nThis article will suggest what employers can do to handle suspected employee misconduct at the workplace, in compliance with employment laws in Singapore. It will cover:\nWhat Can Constitute Employee Misconduct?\nTo determine the relevant course of action to undertake, an employer should first determine whether the employee’s act in question constitutes misconduct.\nEmployee misconduct refers to an employee’s failure to fulfil the conditions of his or her employment in the\nemployment contract\n. Acts that may constitute misconduct in the workplace include theft, dishonesty, or disorderly or immoral conduct.\nFor instance, in 2021, an employee of a printing services company was found guilty of criminal breach of trust by committing acts of misconduct in the form of theft. There, the employee had abused his position as the production manager by using the printing resources entrusted to him, such as ink and paper, for his personal freelance clients.\nSimilarly, embezzling funds or\nleaking confidential company information\nto external actors would constitute dishonest misconduct on the part of the employee who carries out such acts.\nInsubordination to superiors may also constitute employee misconduct in the form of disorderly conduct. Insubordinate behaviour refers to conduct where an employee refuses to comply with directions issued in the workplace without valid reasons. However, where the employee is directed to engage in illegal activities, this could constitute a legitimate reason for the employee’s non-compliance.\nMisconduct in violation of implied conditions of employment\nThe scope of employee misconduct can extend beyond any behaviour expressly contained in the employment contract. Under\nsection 14 of the Employment Act\n, an employee may be dismissed for the failure to conduct oneself in a manner inconsistent with the express or implied conditions of his or her service.\nImplied terms\nof an employment contract could include terms relevant to the employee’s job scope, even if these terms have not been expressly stated in the employment contract.\nFor instance, under an employment contract between an employee of a bakery and the bakery owner, the employee would be expected to have free access to the baked goods for sale to customers. At the same time, although this requirement may not be written down in the employment contract, the employee would be expected to not help himself to the baked goods whenever he feels hungry notwithstanding such free access. A violation of such an implied term could amount to misconduct in the form of theft.\nWhat Can You Do If You Suspect Employee Misconduct?\nIf you suspect that your employee has been engaging in activities that could constitute employee misconduct, you should address the matter in a manner consistent with the\nMinistry of Manpower’s recommendations\n.\nFollowing the guidelines can assist you with the process of managing employee misconduct in accordance with the relevant laws.\nInvestigate the suspected misconduct\nAfter deciding to address your employee’s potential misconduct, you should preliminarily investigate the situation. Although doing so is not a legal requirement, it can help you obtain concrete proof of the suspected misconduct.\nWhen holding an investigation, you may wish to consider\nhiring a corporate private investigator\n. This course of action may be appropriate for misconduct relating to serious breaches such as leaking company secrets or embezzlement. The private investigator can look into the matter and help you to obtain evidence of the suspected misconduct as a third-party not known to the employee in question.\nWhether the investigation uncovers any wrongdoing or otherwise, you should inform the employee of the investigation’s outcome. Employment is a two-way relationship and the court sees it fair for employers to disclose the outcome of the investigation to the affected employee. This is regardless of whether employers are legally obliged to make such a disclosure.\nConduct a due inquiry\nTo dismiss an employee on the basis of employee misconduct, a\ndue inquiry\nprocess must first be conducted. This stage generally entails informing the employee in question of the allegations and evidence against him. This ensures that the employee has an opportunity to explain his or her side of the story. It is also recommended that the person hearing the inquiry is not someone who may be in a position of bias.\nAlthough an employer cannot dismiss an employee before conducting a due inquiry and revealing the findings of misconduct, there are certain interim measures available to the employer.\nAn employer may suspend an employee from work for a maximum duration of 1 week. This duration can be extended if the employer successfully applies to the Commissioner for Labour for a longer period of suspension. However, the application must be sought at least 3 working days before the end of the 1-week suspension. If the employer chooses to suspend the employee, the employee must be paid at least half his or her salary during the period of suspension.\nWhat to Do If No Misconduct is Found\nIf, at the end of the inquiry, no misconduct is disclosed on the part of the employee, then the amount of any salary withheld must be restored in full.\nBesides the legal implications, an allegation of misconduct against an employee is serious. Thus, an employee who had been wrongly suspected of such misconduct may feel aggrieved. To avoid potential misunderstanding and antagonism within the workplace, it may be sensible to take measures such as issuing a company-wide broadcast explaining the outcome as well as an apology where appropriate.\nWhat to Do If Misconduct is Found\nIf your employee is found to have committed an act of misconduct after the due inquiry process, you may wish to consider taking any one of the possible disciplinary measures:\nDowngrade the employee\nAn employer can instantly downgrade the employee’s position at work.\nSuspend the employee\nAn employer can immediately suspend the employee from attending work without pay for up to one week.\nWhile the foregoing disciplinary measures may be available and effective, the employer may find it appropriate to give employees a chance to change their behaviour in certain circumstances. This may be likely where the employer regards the employee as an asset to the business and the misconduct in question had been due to the employee’s inadvertence.\nTerminate the employment\nAn employer who has established misconduct on the part of his employee can terminate the employee’s employment without prior notice. In this case, the employer will not need to pay salary in lieu of notice.\nHowever, an employee who is terminated as such may seek to\nchallenge the dismissal on the basis that it was wrongful\npursuant to section 14(2) of the Employment Act.\nLodge a police report for the commission of a criminal offence\nIf the employee’s behaviour might constitute misconduct as well as a criminal offence, the employer can choose to file a police report. Examples where this may be the case include misconduct involving the embezzlement of company funds, which could constitute the offence of a\ncriminal breach of trust\n, and accepting or giving bribes in violation of\nSingapore’s corruption laws\n.\nThroughout the process, the employer should cooperate with the investigations and provide the police and prosecution with any relevant information or documents as requested. If charged and convicted of an offence, the employee faces a potential imprisonment term and/or a fine.\nHow to Prevent Employee Misconduct\nEmployee misconduct matters can pose undesirable disruptions to your business. To avoid such disruptions, it can be helpful to take certain preventive steps.\nFor instance, instituting clear guidelines as to employee conduct, as well as use of company data or other property, can help to reinforce expectations and convey the message that infringements will not be condoned. Conducting regular audits by engaging third-party services can also facilitate the identification and reporting of inconsistencies.\n—\nWhile employee misconduct has the potential to inflict substantial and lasting detriment to a business, it is important to adequately investigate each matter in accordance with the law. Ad-hoc measures adopted without reference to officially published recommendations and legal requirements may potentially prejudice employees suspected of misconduct, and could also implicate your business with potential violations of employment laws.\nIf you are concerned about potential misconduct in your workplace, it is highly advisable for you to\nconsult an employment disputes lawyer\nto guide you through the matter.

If their employers suspect them of having misconducted themselves, they may be tempted to let go of the employee in question. However, termination is a serious matter and would be premature where the misconduct is merely suspected and not proven yet.\nThis article will suggest what employers can do to handle suspected employee misconduct at the workplace, in compliance with employment laws in Singapore. It will cover:\nWhat Can Constitute Employee Misconduct?\nTo determine the relevant course of action to undertake, an employer should first determine whether the employee’s act in question constitutes misconduct.\nEmployee misconduct refers to an employee’s failure to fulfil the conditions of his or her employment in the\nemployment contract\n. Acts that may constitute misconduct in the workplace include theft, dishonesty, or disorderly or immoral conduct.\nFor instance, in 2021, an employee of a printing services company was found guilty of criminal breach of trust by committing acts of misconduct in the form of theft. There, the employee had abused his position as the production manager by using the printing resources entrusted to him, such as ink and paper, for his personal freelance clients.\nSimilarly, embezzling funds or\nleaking confidential company information\nto external actors would constitute dishonest misconduct on the part of the employee who carries out such acts.\nInsubordination to superiors may also constitute employee misconduct in the form of disorderly conduct. Insubordinate behaviour refers to conduct where an employee refuses to comply with directions issued in the workplace without valid reasons. However, where the employee is directed to engage in illegal activities, this could constitute a legitimate reason for the employee’s non-compliance.\nMisconduct in violation of implied conditions of employment\nThe scope of employee misconduct can extend beyond any behaviour expressly contained in the employment contract. Under\nsection 14 of the Employment Act\n, an employee may be dismissed for the failure to conduct oneself in a manner inconsistent with the express or implied conditions of his or her service.\nImplied terms\nof an employment contract could include terms relevant to the employee’s job scope, even if these terms have not been expressly stated in the employment contract.\nFor instance, under an employment contract between an employee of a bakery and the bakery owner, the employee would be expected to have free access to the baked goods for sale to customers. At the same time, although this requirement may not be written down in the employment contract, the employee would be expected to not help himself to the baked goods whenever he feels hungry notwithstanding such free access. A violation of such an implied term could amount to misconduct in the form of theft.\nWhat Can You Do If You Suspect Employee Misconduct?\nIf you suspect that your employee has been engaging in activities that could constitute employee misconduct, you should address the matter in a manner consistent with the\nMinistry of Manpower’s recommendations\n.\nFollowing the guidelines can assist you with the process of managing employee misconduct in accordance with the relevant laws.\nInvestigate the suspected misconduct\nAfter deciding to address your employee’s potential misconduct, you should preliminarily investigate the situation. Although doing so is not a legal requirement, it can help you obtain concrete proof of the suspected misconduct.\nWhen holding an investigation, you may wish to consider\nhiring a corporate private investigator\n. This course of action may be appropriate for misconduct relating to serious breaches such as leaking company secrets or embezzlement. The private investigator can look into the matter and help you to obtain evidence of the suspected misconduct as a third-party not known to the employee in question.\nWhether the investigation uncovers any wrongdoing or otherwise, you should inform the employee of the investigation’s outcome. Employment is a two-way relationship and the court sees it fair for employers to disclose the outcome of the investigation to the affected employee. This is regardless of whether employers are legally obliged to make such a disclosure.\nConduct a due inquiry\nTo dismiss an employee on the basis of employee misconduct, a\ndue inquiry\nprocess must first be conducted. This stage generally entails informing the employee in question of the allegations and evidence against him. This ensures that the employee has an opportunity to explain his or her side of the story. It is also recommended that the person hearing the inquiry is not someone who may be in a position of bias.\nAlthough an employer cannot dismiss an employee before conducting a due inquiry and revealing the findings of misconduct, there are certain interim measures available to the employer.\nAn employer may suspend an employee from work for a maximum duration of 1 week. This duration can be extended if the employer successfully applies to the Commissioner for Labour for a longer period of suspension. However, the application must be sought at least 3 working days before the end of the 1-week suspension. If the employer chooses to suspend the employee, the employee must be paid at least half his or her salary during the period of suspension.\nWhat to Do If No Misconduct is Found\nIf, at the end of the inquiry, no misconduct is disclosed on the part of the employee, then the amount of any salary withheld must be restored in full.\nBesides the legal implications, an allegation of misconduct against an employee is serious. Thus, an employee who had been wrongly suspected of such misconduct may feel aggrieved. To avoid potential misunderstanding and antagonism within the workplace, it may be sensible to take measures such as issuing a company-wide broadcast explaining the outcome as well as an apology where appropriate.\nWhat to Do If Misconduct is Found\nIf your employee is found to have committed an act of misconduct after the due inquiry process, you may wish to consider taking any one of the possible disciplinary measures:\nDowngrade the employee\nAn employer can instantly downgrade the employee’s position at work.\nSuspend the employee\nAn employer can immediately suspend the employee from attending work without pay for up to one week.\nWhile the foregoing disciplinary measures may be available and effective, the employer may find it appropriate to give employees a chance to change their behaviour in certain circumstances. This may be likely where the employer regards the employee as an asset to the business and the misconduct in question had been due to the employee’s inadvertence.\nTerminate the employment\nAn employer who has established misconduct on the part of his employee can terminate the employee’s employment without prior notice. In this case, the employer will not need to pay salary in lieu of notice.\nHowever, an employee who is terminated as such may seek to\nchallenge the dismissal on the basis that it was wrongful\npursuant to section 14(2) of the Employment Act.\nLodge a police report for the commission of a criminal offence\nIf the employee’s behaviour might constitute misconduct as well as a criminal offence, the employer can choose to file a police report. Examples where this may be the case include misconduct involving the embezzlement of company funds, which could constitute the offence of a\ncriminal breach of trust\n, and accepting or giving bribes in violation of\nSingapore’s corruption laws\n.\nThroughout the process, the employer should cooperate with the investigations and provide the police and prosecution with any relevant information or documents as requested. If charged and convicted of an offence, the employee faces a potential imprisonment term and/or a fine.\nHow to Prevent Employee Misconduct\nEmployee misconduct matters can pose undesirable disruptions to your business. To avoid such disruptions, it can be helpful to take certain preventive steps.\nFor instance, instituting clear guidelines as to employee conduct, as well as use of company data or other property, can help to reinforce expectations and convey the message that infringements will not be condoned. Conducting regular audits by engaging third-party services can also facilitate the identification and reporting of inconsistencies.\n—\nWhile employee misconduct has the potential to inflict substantial and lasting detriment to a business, it is important to adequately investigate each matter in accordance with the law. Ad-hoc measures adopted without reference to officially published recommendations and legal requirements may potentially prejudice employees suspected of misconduct, and could also implicate your business with potential violations of employment laws.\nIf you are concerned about potential misconduct in your workplace, it is highly advisable for you to\nconsult an employment disputes lawyer\nto guide you through the matter. A lawyer will be able to advise you on the appropriate course of action to take after considering the specific context. This includes your specific area of work, which may present unique considerations.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

It is thus perhaps unsurprising that remote working has, and will become increasingly common among Singaporeans.\nWhile the benefits of remote working, such as being able to be close to one’s loved ones and having more flexibility as to one’s working environment, are well-known, the potential legal issues that may arise for remote workers working from Singapore for an overseas employer, are less spoken of. This article will discuss the following topics:\nWhat is a Remote Worker?\nA remote worker is an employee who does his/her job from a location other than the physical office operated by the employer. Such locations may range from the employee’s home, or even a co-working space. The location need not even be in the country as that of the office operated by the employer. For example, if the employer is based in London and has no office in Singapore, but would like to hire a Singaporean employee, the employer can allow the employee to work remotely from Singapore, and he/she would be considered a remote worker.\nSome common job roles which have the most opportunities for remote work include: web developers, software engineers, translators, editors, data scientists, cyber security, copywriters, account managers, architects, and data analysts.\nWhat Laws Apply to Remote Workers Hired by an Overseas Company?\nThe main statute governing labour law in Singapore is the Employment Act (EA). It provides for the basic terms and conditions at work for employees covered by the EA.\nThe EA covers all employees (regardless of nationality) so long as they work under a contract of service with an employer (\ni.e.\nan agreement in which the employer agrees to employ a person as an employee, and the person agrees to serve the employer as an employee), with the exception of seamen, domestic workers, and any person employed by a statutory board or the Government.\nThe EA also applies regardless of the type of employment structure that you are under. The three most common types of employment structures are set out and briefly explained below:\nFull-time employment\n: Full-time employees typically work an average of 40 hours a week and are paid a monthly salary. They are eligible for employment benefits such as medical and dental benefits, paid annual leave etc.\nPart-time employment\n: Typically, part-time employees work less than 35 hours a week and are paid by the hour, rather than a monthly salary. Part-time employees are also usually eligible for employment benefits that full-time employees enjoy.\nIndependent contractor/freelancer\n: Independent contractors/freelancers are persons who are sourced by a company to perform work or services for a particular project or over a fixed period of time. They typically are not required to put in fixed hours, and the monetary compensation that they receive is tied to the particular work or service that they are contracted to perform.\nThus, the position is relatively straightforward if you are an employee of a Singapore-based employer – your employment relationship with your employer will be regulated by the EA.\nHowever, if you are a remote worker employed by a foreign company and working in Singapore, it is not as clear if you will be covered under the EA. While the provisions of the EA are broad enough such that they can cover remote workers based in and working in Singapore, regardless of where their employer is based, the EA does not expressly spell out its territorial scope. In contrast, the labour laws of certain other countries expressly define the territorial scope of their legislation. For example, in Australia, certain employment rights apply to all employees working in Australia as well as employees of an Australian-based employer, regardless of where the employee works from. In Ontario, Canada, the labour legislation also applies to work performed outside Ontario, so long as it is a continuation of work performed in Ontario.\nTherefore, there may be situations where the employer may argue that the remote worker should not be able to avail him/herself of the protection of the EA. Two such scenarios are set out below:\nScenario 1\n: You are hired as a full-time employee in Singapore. The company is headquartered overseas and does not have\nany\npresence in Singapore (\ni.e.\nthe company does not have a branch office in Singapore). As your employment contract is entered into between yourself and the overseas headquarters directly,\nthe contract is drafted according to the laws of that country, and not Singapore law\n. As such, the contract expressly states that the governing law of the contract is the law of the foreign country, and also that the provisions of the law of the foreign country will apply because they relate to your underlying work and employment relationship more than the law of Singapore. In this scenario, the employer would likely be able to successfully argue that you should not be able to come within the protection of the EA.\nScenario 2\n: You are hired as a full-time employee in Singapore. The company is headquartered overseas and does not have\nany\npresence in Singapore. However,\nyour employment contract is silent on the governing law\n(\ni.e.\nit is not specified in the contract whether the law of the foreign country or the law of Singapore will apply). In such a situation, depending on certain relevant but non-exhaustive factors such as where you live, where the employer’s head office is based, and other administrative details connected with the employment (e.g. where and in what currency your salary is paid), a case could be made either way as to whether the EA applies to your employment relationship or not. Naturally, the less of a connection there is to Singapore, the stronger the employer’s case that you should not be able to avail yourself of the protection of the EA.\nWhat Can Remote Workers Do in the Event of a Dispute With Their Overseas Employer?\nAt the outset, if you are a remote worker and you get into an employment dispute with your overseas employer, you may potentially face procedural and practical difficulties with bringing your claim against your overseas employer, for the following reasons:\nFirst, in Singapore, one of the main avenues for resolving employment disputes is the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT), which is a tribunal under the State Courts. The ECT covers any employee protected under the EA and handles salary-related and wrongful dismissal claims. However, claims filed in the ECT cannot be served on persons or entities outside Singapore. Such procedural and practical difficulties would not pose as much of a problem if your employment contract is with the Singapore branch office of an overseas employer, in which case, your employment dispute will just be against a Singaporean entity.\nSecond, even if you wish to bring your claim in the country in which your overseas employer is based, you may not be able to do so. While many other countries have local labour tribunals (similar in nature and function to that of the ECT) which are dedicated to addressing employment disputes, employees who are employed abroad may not be able to seek recourse before such tribunals.\nTherefore, in the event of a dispute with your overseas employer, the option that is most likely to be available is to file a private claim in the civil courts, whether in Singapore or in the country in which your overseas employer is based. However, this may require you to engage lawyers in Singapore and/or in the country in which your overseas employer is based, who will assist you in pursuing your claim.\nFurther, commencing a private claim in the civil courts can be a lengthy and often costly process, which may be further complicated by the need to navigate a foreign and unfamiliar legal landscape.\nWhat are Some Practical Steps that Remote Workers Can Take to Protect Their Interests/Safeguard Their Employment Rights?\nIf you are considering taking up a role as a remote worker with an overseas employer, these are a few steps that you can and should take to ensure that your interests are protected:\nYou should review the terms of your contract/employment agreement carefully, and make sure that you agree with all the terms in your contract before signing on it. A good starting point for what to look out for are\nKey Employment Terms\n, which all contracts of service governed by the EA must contain. Such terms include your working arrangements (e.g. expected working hours and rest days), salary-related terms (e.g. basic salary, salary period, allowances, deductions, overtime rate of pay), leave entitlements, medical benefits, probation period and notice period. Other terms that you may wish to look out for are whether there is adequate insurance coverage, and any termination provisions. If any of the abovementioned terms are not expressly provided for in your contract/employment agreement, you should consider asking for them to be inserted.\nIf the contract/employment agreement is unclear as to what the applicable laws are, you should also clarify with your prospective employer the applicable laws, and possibly even request that it be specified in the contract/employment agreement to minimise any unnecessary confusion if a dispute arises.\n—\nDue to the unique circumstances of remote workers, it is less clear what employment rights and protections remote workers enjoy, as compared to a traditional employment relationship where the employee and employer are based in the same location. Further, there may be practical and procedural difficulties in even enforcing such rights and availing oneself of such protections.\nThus, if you are considering a remote working position, you may wish to\nseek further guidance and advice from an employment lawyer\non any of the above issues. An employment lawyer will also be able to help with reviewing your contract/employment agreement to ensure that the terms contained therein are sufficiently clear to protect your interests.\nIn the event of a dispute, an\nemployment disputes lawyer\nwill be able to advise you on your rights, as well as assist you in making any claims against your employer.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

While many other countries have local labour tribunals (similar in nature and function to that of the ECT) which are dedicated to addressing employment disputes, employees who are employed abroad may not be able to seek recourse before such tribunals.\nTherefore, in the event of a dispute with your overseas employer, the option that is most likely to be available is to file a private claim in the civil courts, whether in Singapore or in the country in which your overseas employer is based. However, this may require you to engage lawyers in Singapore and/or in the country in which your overseas employer is based, who will assist you in pursuing your claim.\nFurther, commencing a private claim in the civil courts can be a lengthy and often costly process, which may be further complicated by the need to navigate a foreign and unfamiliar legal landscape.\nWhat are Some Practical Steps that Remote Workers Can Take to Protect Their Interests/Safeguard Their Employment Rights?\nIf you are considering taking up a role as a remote worker with an overseas employer, these are a few steps that you can and should take to ensure that your interests are protected:\nYou should review the terms of your contract/employment agreement carefully, and make sure that you agree with all the terms in your contract before signing on it. A good starting point for what to look out for are\nKey Employment Terms\n, which all contracts of service governed by the EA must contain. Such terms include your working arrangements (e.g. expected working hours and rest days), salary-related terms (e.g. basic salary, salary period, allowances, deductions, overtime rate of pay), leave entitlements, medical benefits, probation period and notice period. Other terms that you may wish to look out for are whether there is adequate insurance coverage, and any termination provisions. If any of the abovementioned terms are not expressly provided for in your contract/employment agreement, you should consider asking for them to be inserted.\nIf the contract/employment agreement is unclear as to what the applicable laws are, you should also clarify with your prospective employer the applicable laws, and possibly even request that it be specified in the contract/employment agreement to minimise any unnecessary confusion if a dispute arises.\n—\nDue to the unique circumstances of remote workers, it is less clear what employment rights and protections remote workers enjoy, as compared to a traditional employment relationship where the employee and employer are based in the same location. Further, there may be practical and procedural difficulties in even enforcing such rights and availing oneself of such protections.\nThus, if you are considering a remote working position, you may wish to\nseek further guidance and advice from an employment lawyer\non any of the above issues. An employment lawyer will also be able to help with reviewing your contract/employment agreement to ensure that the terms contained therein are sufficiently clear to protect your interests.\nIn the event of a dispute, an\nemployment disputes lawyer\nwill be able to advise you on your rights, as well as assist you in making any claims against your employer.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

While the decrease might seem promising, there is a possibility of unreported workplace harassment.\nIf you are a victim of workplace abuse in Singapore, removing yourself from a toxic or abusive workplace situation is certainly not as easy and straightforward. However, there are certain steps you may be able to take. In this article, we will cover:\nTypes of Workplace Abuse in Singapore\nWorkplace abuse may occur in different forms, and what would amount to abuse might not be as straightforward. Possible types of workplace abuse in Singapore may include:\nVerbal abuse\nPhysical abuse\nHarassment in general or sexual harassment\nForced to work unreasonably long hours\nThere is no quick fix or one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to responding to workplace abuse. Nonetheless, if you are a victim of workplace abuse, bear in mind that there are several avenues of criminal and/or civil recourse available for you to rely on.\nVerbal abuse\nVerbal abuse may occur either in person (face to face) or via text. Such abuse may constitute a harassment offence under the Protection from Harassment Act (more on harassment below) or may also amount to the offence of criminal intimidation.\nCriminal intimidation\nCriminal intimidation\nis committed when someone threatens to cause injury to either your body, reputation or property, or the body or reputation of anyone that you know, while intending to:\nCause alarm;\nCause you to do an act that you are not legally required to do; or\nStop you from doing an act that you are legally entitled to do.\nIf the person who made abusive comments and/or statements to you is found guilty of committing criminal intimidation, he/she may face a punishment of up to 2 years’ jail and/or a fine.\nFurther, aggravated threats of criminal intimidation, such as threatening to cause death or grievous hurt, would attract a jail term of up to 10 years and/or a fine.\nPhysical abuse\nYou could also be a victim of physical abuse, which could refer to any form of deliberate body harm and/or contact, including:\nForceful poking\nSlapping\nHitting\nPunching\nUnder Singapore law, an individual may be charged with\nvoluntarily causing hurt\nand using criminal force for physical assault. An offender may be jailed for up to 3 years and/or fined up to $5,000 for voluntarily causing hurt, and be jailed for up to 3 months and/or fined up to $1,500 for using criminal force.\nIn 2019 for example, entertainment lawyer Samuel Seow was charged in court for his physically abusive behaviour towards two of his employees, including:\nForcefully poking an employee with his finger and pushing; and\nHitting his employees, resulting in tenderness and bruises over their body parts, such as their arm and thigh.\nHe eventually\npleaded guilty\nto using criminal force and voluntarily causing hurt to his employees.\nHarassment\nIf you have been subject to threatening, insulting, demeaning and abusive comments, you are likely a victim of workplace harassment. Such comments could have been directed at you either at your workplace, or even during other work-related occasions.\nWorkplace harassment is a criminal offence under the\nProtection from Harassment Act\n. An offender can expect to be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed for up to 6 months.\nFurther, a victim of verbal abuse may sue the harasser for compensation, and on top of that, apply for a\nProtection Order (PO) or Enhanced Protection Order (EPO)\nto stop the unwanted behaviour and/or communication of the harasser.\nSexual harassment\nSexual harassment, which refers to the making of unwelcome sexual advancements, is another possible form of workplace abuse. A total of\n73 protection orders were filed for sexual harassment\nat the Protection from Harassment Court in 2023, a slight increase from the 69 such orders filed in 2022.\nSexual harassment may come in various forms, including:\nBeing on the receiving end of sexual remarks\nReceiving pictures and/or texts of a sexual nature, or even being “flashed” at (i.e. if a person exposes their genitals to you)\nBeing asked questions about your appearance, body or sexual activities\nBeing physically touched against your will, such as when a person places a hand on your thigh, or if a man uses his penis to penetrate your vagina, anus or mouth without your consent\nBeing secretly filmed while doing a private act, such as changing clothes or using the urinal\nDepending on the exact incident(s), some of these conducts would be caught as criminal offences under the Penal Code, including\nvoyeurism\n,\noutrage of modesty\n,\nrape\nand sexual assault. Victims may also seek civil and criminal remedies under the Protection from Harassment Act.\nYou can find out more from our articles on\nwhat can victims of sexual harassment in Singapore do\n, and\nsexual misconduct in Singapore\nin general.\nBeing made to work very long hours\nIf you are:\nA workman doing manual labour and earning less than $4,500 a month; or\nAn employee earning less than $2,600,\nyou should be aware that it is illegal for your employer to make you work more than 12 hours a day unless your employer has applied for an overtime exemption for you to work up to 14 hours a day. You should also not be made to work more than 72 overtime hours in a month, unless your employer had similarly applied for an overtime exemption.\nIf you have been forced to work extremely long hours that exceed the abovementioned limits, your employer may be charged under the Employment Act for breaches in working hours and overtime limits. An employer could be fined up to $5,000 for a first offence. Heavier penalties of a jail term of up to a year and/or a fine of up to $10,000 would apply for repeat offenders.\nFor example, in 2021, private security agencies Erawan Security Services and Volantra Security were discovered to have made their security officers work back-to-back shifts, causing them to work more than 12 hours a day on multiple days over a span of 2 months. They were\nconsequently charged\nfor breaching the limits on working hours.\nWhat Can I Do If I am a Victim of Workplace Abuse?\nIf you believe you have been or are a victim of workplace abuse, there are options available to you. You can:\nApproach a close and trusted friend or family member for support\n. This can be a good first step to work through your emotions before deciding on any further course of action.\nDocument and keep records of incidents\n. If you experience instances of abuse at work, you should document the facts and specific behaviour of the abuse and keep a record of who your witnesses are. This way, you would help yourself to build a credible testimony of your experiences if you eventually make a report to seek help.\nInform your supervisor, human resource (HR) officer, or management\n. Escalating the workplace abuse to your supervisor, HR officer or management is an important step to take, as they would have the authority to intervene quickly to ensure your safety and well-being. If your company has a buddy or other peer support programmes, you can also inform your buddy for support. As every organisation will have different procedures to handle complaints, such as for sexual misconduct, you should follow the protocols provided to employees to bring the matter to light. Once the matter has been resolved, you may be informed of the measures that were taken against the party who committed the sexual misconduct. These measures can range from counselling to dismissal.\nFile a report with the Ministry of Manpower via its\nwebsite\n, and/or the\nTripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)\n. You may want to submit a report to MOM to inform them about any possible breaches of employment law so they can investigate and follow up on the matter. Rest assured that your identity and information provided can be kept strictly confidential. Alternatively, you may also reach out toTAFEP, an agency dedicated to the promotion of fair, responsible and progressive employment practices. They can help employees facing workplace harassment by advising on what steps to take (e.g. filing a police report or seeking protection orders) and intervene if your company adopts unacceptable employment practices, such as not handling the employees’ complaints properly or fairly.\nReport the incident(s) to the police\n. You can also report the matter to the police if you are physically harmed or are facing threat of harm. The police will investigate possible criminal offences and pursue criminal charges if there are any.\n—\nWorkplace abuse should never be tolerated. If you are a victim of workplace abuse in Singapore or know someone who is experiencing workplace abuse, do not be afraid to seek help for yourself or for your loved ones. As discussed above, there are multiple avenues for redress, including civil and criminal recourse.\nIf you are a victim, you can also seek advice from our harassment lawyers, who will be able to help you assess the strength of your case and advise you on the next steps. This way, you will be able to deal with your situation safely and appropriately.\nGet in touch with experienced harassment lawyers in Singapore here.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Such abuse may constitute a harassment offence under the Protection from Harassment Act (more on harassment below) or may also amount to the offence of criminal intimidation.\nCriminal intimidation\nCriminal intimidation\nis committed when someone threatens to cause injury to either your body, reputation or property, or the body or reputation of anyone that you know, while intending to:\nCause alarm;\nCause you to do an act that you are not legally required to do; or\nStop you from doing an act that you are legally entitled to do.\nIf the person who made abusive comments and/or statements to you is found guilty of committing criminal intimidation, he/she may face a punishment of up to 2 years’ jail and/or a fine.\nFurther, aggravated threats of criminal intimidation, such as threatening to cause death or grievous hurt, would attract a jail term of up to 10 years and/or a fine.\nPhysical abuse\nYou could also be a victim of physical abuse, which could refer to any form of deliberate body harm and/or contact, including:\nForceful poking\nSlapping\nHitting\nPunching\nUnder Singapore law, an individual may be charged with\nvoluntarily causing hurt\nand using criminal force for physical assault. An offender may be jailed for up to 3 years and/or fined up to $5,000 for voluntarily causing hurt, and be jailed for up to 3 months and/or fined up to $1,500 for using criminal force.\nIn 2019 for example, entertainment lawyer Samuel Seow was charged in court for his physically abusive behaviour towards two of his employees, including:\nForcefully poking an employee with his finger and pushing; and\nHitting his employees, resulting in tenderness and bruises over their body parts, such as their arm and thigh.\nHe eventually\npleaded guilty\nto using criminal force and voluntarily causing hurt to his employees.\nHarassment\nIf you have been subject to threatening, insulting, demeaning and abusive comments, you are likely a victim of workplace harassment. Such comments could have been directed at you either at your workplace, or even during other work-related occasions.\nWorkplace harassment is a criminal offence under the\nProtection from Harassment Act\n. An offender can expect to be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed for up to 6 months.\nFurther, a victim of verbal abuse may sue the harasser for compensation, and on top of that, apply for a\nProtection Order (PO) or Enhanced Protection Order (EPO)\nto stop the unwanted behaviour and/or communication of the harasser.\nSexual harassment\nSexual harassment, which refers to the making of unwelcome sexual advancements, is another possible form of workplace abuse. A total of\n73 protection orders were filed for sexual harassment\nat the Protection from Harassment Court in 2023, a slight increase from the 69 such orders filed in 2022.\nSexual harassment may come in various forms, including:\nBeing on the receiving end of sexual remarks\nReceiving pictures and/or texts of a sexual nature, or even being “flashed” at (i.e. if a person exposes their genitals to you)\nBeing asked questions about your appearance, body or sexual activities\nBeing physically touched against your will, such as when a person places a hand on your thigh, or if a man uses his penis to penetrate your vagina, anus or mouth without your consent\nBeing secretly filmed while doing a private act, such as changing clothes or using the urinal\nDepending on the exact incident(s), some of these conducts would be caught as criminal offences under the Penal Code, including\nvoyeurism\n,\noutrage of modesty\n,\nrape\nand sexual assault. Victims may also seek civil and criminal remedies under the Protection from Harassment Act.\nYou can find out more from our articles on\nwhat can victims of sexual harassment in Singapore do\n, and\nsexual misconduct in Singapore\nin general.\nBeing made to work very long hours\nIf you are:\nA workman doing manual labour and earning less than $4,500 a month; or\nAn employee earning less than $2,600,\nyou should be aware that it is illegal for your employer to make you work more than 12 hours a day unless your employer has applied for an overtime exemption for you to work up to 14 hours a day. You should also not be made to work more than 72 overtime hours in a month, unless your employer had similarly applied for an overtime exemption.\nIf you have been forced to work extremely long hours that exceed the abovementioned limits, your employer may be charged under the Employment Act for breaches in working hours and overtime limits. An employer could be fined up to $5,000 for a first offence. Heavier penalties of a jail term of up to a year and/or a fine of up to $10,000 would apply for repeat offenders.\nFor example, in 2021, private security agencies Erawan Security Services and Volantra Security were discovered to have made their security officers work back-to-back shifts, causing them to work more than 12 hours a day on multiple days over a span of 2 months. They were\nconsequently charged\nfor breaching the limits on working hours.\nWhat Can I Do If I am a Victim of Workplace Abuse?\nIf you believe you have been or are a victim of workplace abuse, there are options available to you. You can:\nApproach a close and trusted friend or family member for support\n. This can be a good first step to work through your emotions before deciding on any further course of action.\nDocument and keep records of incidents\n. If you experience instances of abuse at work, you should document the facts and specific behaviour of the abuse and keep a record of who your witnesses are. This way, you would help yourself to build a credible testimony of your experiences if you eventually make a report to seek help.\nInform your supervisor, human resource (HR) officer, or management\n. Escalating the workplace abuse to your supervisor, HR officer or management is an important step to take, as they would have the authority to intervene quickly to ensure your safety and well-being. If your company has a buddy or other peer support programmes, you can also inform your buddy for support. As every organisation will have different procedures to handle complaints, such as for sexual misconduct, you should follow the protocols provided to employees to bring the matter to light. Once the matter has been resolved, you may be informed of the measures that were taken against the party who committed the sexual misconduct. These measures can range from counselling to dismissal.\nFile a report with the Ministry of Manpower via its\nwebsite\n, and/or the\nTripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)\n. You may want to submit a report to MOM to inform them about any possible breaches of employment law so they can investigate and follow up on the matter. Rest assured that your identity and information provided can be kept strictly confidential. Alternatively, you may also reach out toTAFEP, an agency dedicated to the promotion of fair, responsible and progressive employment practices. They can help employees facing workplace harassment by advising on what steps to take (e.g. filing a police report or seeking protection orders) and intervene if your company adopts unacceptable employment practices, such as not handling the employees’ complaints properly or fairly.\nReport the incident(s) to the police\n. You can also report the matter to the police if you are physically harmed or are facing threat of harm. The police will investigate possible criminal offences and pursue criminal charges if there are any.\n—\nWorkplace abuse should never be tolerated. If you are a victim of workplace abuse in Singapore or know someone who is experiencing workplace abuse, do not be afraid to seek help for yourself or for your loved ones. As discussed above, there are multiple avenues for redress, including civil and criminal recourse.\nIf you are a victim, you can also seek advice from our harassment lawyers, who will be able to help you assess the strength of your case and advise you on the next steps. This way, you will be able to deal with your situation safely and appropriately.\nGet in touch with experienced harassment lawyers in Singapore here.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

{"chunk_id": "SLA_cdfa17d3", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "6 Common Employment Disputes & What You Can Do", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employment Disputes > 6 Common Employment Disputes & What You Can Do", "text": "6 Common Employment Disputes & What You Can Do\nLast updated on June 12, 2025\nEmployment disputes may arise in the course of employment, or even during the hiring process. In the event of a dispute, it is important for all parties to know their legal rights and obligations.\nThis article aims to provide a general overview of the common types of employment disputes you might come across and what you, as an employee or employer, can do to resolve such disputes.\nWhat are Employment Contracts?\nEmployment contracts (also known as a contract of service) set out the terms and conditions of employment with a company/organisation. The contract must include key employment terms and essential clauses pertaining to employment. These include an employee’s work hours, salary, leave benefits and job scope. Such a contract is usually in writing and can be in the form of a letter of appointment or employment.\nFor more details on employment contracts, you may refer to this\nguide to employment agreements in Singapore\n.\nWhat are Some Common Employment Contract Disputes?\nCommon employment contract disputes include wrongful dismissal, dismissal without just or sufficient cause, and wage-related disputes. The enforceability of non-compete clauses may also be disputed when an employee leaves the company to join a competitor organisation.\nApart from employment contracts, occasions of harassment and discrimination in the workplace may also lead to aggrieved parties bringing claims against their employer.\nThis article discusses 6 common employment disputes:\n1) Wrongful termination/dismissal\nThe employer and employee both have the right to terminate the employment contract. The contract can be terminated when the employee resigns, the employer dismisses the employee, or if the contract terms have expired.\nIn the case where the employer dismisses the employee, the employer has to give notice of the dismissal. The notice period will then have to be served before the employee can be dismissed. The notice period will typically be stipulated in the employment contract or will otherwise depend on the length of employment. For example, if the notice period is 30 calendar days, the employee can only be effectively dismissed 30 calendar days after he/she has been notified of his/her dismissal.\nThe dismissal will amount to a wrongful dismissal if the employee was dismissed without just or sufficient cause, as explained below.\nTermination/dismissal without just or sufficient cause\nUnder the Employment Act, dismissing an employee without just or sufficient cause (i.e. without a valid reason) is wrongful. Generally, a ‘just or sufficient cause’ would include the employee acting dishonestly, employee conduct that demonstrates gross negligence or frequently being absent from work.\nThe only exception for dismissal without notice under the Employment Act is on the grounds of the employee’s misconduct. Misconduct includes but is not limited to theft, dishonest or disorderly conduct at work, insubordination, and bringing the organisation into disrepute. However, a dispute may arise where the employer dismisses an employee on the grounds of misconduct, but the employee wishes to dispute the allegation.\nIf the employer alleges misconduct, the employer\nmust conduct a due inquiry\nbefore dismissing the employee on this ground. Failure to conduct such an inquiry will also amount to a wrongful dismissal.\nAn example where an employee may be dismissed on the grounds of misconduct is as follows: The employee handbook states that employees are not allowed to steal any of the company’s property. The employee was found to have stolen one of the company’s laptops for personal use. The company conducts a due inquiry, allowing the employee to explain why they had done so. If the employee is not able to justify their actions, they may be dismissed without notice on the ground of misconduct. This would not be a case of wrongful dismissal.\nHowever, if the employee was not allowed to explain his case or it was found that the employee was given permission from a superior to use the company’s laptop for their personal use during their employment, their behaviour might not amount to misconduct. If the employee was dismissed without notice under these circumstances, this would amount to a wrongful dismissal.\nOther grounds of wrongful termination/dismissal\nWhere an employer dismisses an employee on the following grounds, it will amount to a wrongful dismissal, even if notice was given to the employee:\nDismissal on\ndiscriminatory grounds\n(e.g., age, race, gender religion etc.)\nDismissal to\ndeprive an employee of benefits or entitlements\n(e.g., to deprive an employee of her maternity benefits, leave entitlements etc.)\nDismissal to\npunish an employee for exercising an employment right\n(e.g., dismissal after employee submitted a request to authorities for salary-related claims)\nA dispute between an employee and employer may arise if the employee believes they have been dismissed on discriminatory grounds. For example, the employer dismisses the employee with notice and no reason was given. However, the employee observed that the employer had made multiple discriminatory comments about the employee’s race and culture, casually stating that he prefers to hire someone of his race instead. The employer’s comments were heard by other employees.\nIn such a situation, the employer had taken a discriminatory attitude towards the employee, and the employer might have dismissed the employee on discriminatory grounds. This would amount to a wrongful dismissal.\nFor more information, you may refer to this guide on\nwrongful dismissal in Singapore\n.\n2) Wage-related disputes\nMost employment contracts will state the prescribed pay structure, giving employees certainty on when they will be paid and the amount to be paid. Pay structures can be on an hourly basis or a monthly basis, depending on the terms of the employment contract. However, there may be situations where employees find that they have not been paid their salary due to them or have not been paid on time. In these circumstances, there are many types of disputes that may arise.\nFor example, a part-time employee may realise upon calculation that his/her salary payment did not include the promised pay rate for working on a public holiday. A dispute may occur when the employee raises this issue to the employer, and the employer disagrees with the calculation. In such a situation, both parties should discuss what was agreed upon. The employee can show proof of the promised rate, if any. If both parties are not able to agree on a specified rate, they should refer to MOM’s website for the\nstandard public holiday pay rate.\nAnother example is if the employer withholds the employee’s salary for month X because the employee failed to meet his/her performance targets for that month. A dispute may arise if the employee asks to be paid despite failing to meet the targets and the employer refuses. According to the Employment Act, the employer must pay the employee’s salary once a month\n. However, if the employment contract stipulates how and when commission is to be paid, payment of the commission would depend on the terms of the employment contract or existing policies or practices. In such a situation, it is likely that the employer will have to pay the employee his/her basic salary, but may be entitled to withhold any commission if it is in accordance with the terms of the employment contract or the company’s policies.\nEmployers and employees alike should be aware of the company’s policies with regard to wages, and ensure that they do not contradict any statutory provisions in the Employment Act.\nFor more details and information on wage-related disputes, you may refer to this article on\nemployee salary\n.\n3) Workplace harassment\nWorkplace harassment can occur when someone at the workplace acts in a way that causes, or is likely to cause you to feel harassed, distressed or alarmed. This includes, but is not limited to, the following acts:\nVerbal abuse (e.g threatening, insulting language used, cyberbullying, or non-verbal gestures)\nPhysical abuse (e.g being pushed, slapped, or punched by a colleague or employer)\nStalking\nSexual harassment\nFor example, A and B are colleagues working together in the same team and in close proximity with one another. A loudly and repeatedly talks about A’s intention to have a sexual relationship with B to other co-workers in an explicit and insulting manner, knowing that B can hear this. This causes B to feel very distressed. Such conduct would therefore amount to workplace harassment.\nUsing the above example, disputes in the workplace may arise if B has brought up B’s discomfort to the company and they dismiss B’s concerns or do not deal with it appropriately. For instance, B raises concerns about A’s comments and behaviour to their organisation’s Human Resources department and requests to be assigned to a different team from A. If the company simply dismisses B’s concerns without conducting any investigation into A’s behaviour and B has to continue working in close proximity with A, B may have ground to take action against the company for not creating a safe working environment.\nEmployers should ensure that they are well-equipped and prepared to handle such situations swiftly and in a sensitive manner. Some best practices that employers should have in place include:\nA procedure where employees can report incidents of harassment;\nAn independent and impartial body to review such incidents;\nAssistance and closure provided to the victim; and\nPunishment or counselling for the harasser.\nEmployers can refer to the\nTripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment\nfor more information on best practices it should follow.\nEmployees should also be familiar with workplace harassment-related procedures in the organisation. Generally, employees should be able to report the matter to the Human Resource (HR) department and an internal investigation should be conducted. If the victim feels that their safety is still at risk, they should file a police report. Do note that harassment within and outside the workplace can also be an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA).\nEmployees and employers alike should check with their respective organisations on the relevant procedures and policies in place. For more details and information, please refer to this article on\nworkplace abuse and possible remedies in Singapore\n.\n4) Workplace discrimination\nWorkplace discrimination occurs when the employee is being discriminated against or treated unfairly due to factors like the employee’s age, gender, race, religion, language, marital status and family responsibility, disability\n.\nDisputes may arise if employers deny employees opportunities or treat them unfairly due to the factors mentioned above. For example, employers should not make snide remarks about nor ban religious headcovers in the workplace if it does not pose any safety risks. Female employees who are pregnant should also not be denied work opportunities or be passed on for job promotions simply because they have to take maternity leave after giving birth.\nThe Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness (Tripartite Committee) released an interim report in February 2023 which proposed new laws and rules to protect workers from discrimination.These include protecting workers from discrimination based on age, nationality, sex, marital status, pregnancy status, caregiving responsibilities, race, religion, language, disability and mental health conditions.\nA more detailed discussion can be found in our other article on the\nNew Proposed Discrimination Laws in Singapore\n.\nCurrently, employers are expected to abide by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP Guidelines), to recruit and select employees based on merit, to treat employees fairly, provide employees with equal opportunity, reward employees fairly and to abide by labour laws. If employees feel that they are denied opportunities or rewards simply due to any of the factors mentioned above, they may raise an issue with the employer.\nFor more information on discrimination in hiring practices, employers may refer to this article on\ndiscriminatory hiring practices in Singapore\n.\n5) Severance agreements\nA severance agreement outlines the financial terms on which the employee will be terminated. Severance pay is often offered as part of the terms of the severance agreement, in exchange for an employee’s release of their claims against the employer. Employees who have served the company for at least 2 years are eligible for severance pay, along with other retrenchment benefits. Those with less than 2 years’ service could be paid a severance pay out of the company’s goodwill.\nEmployers may choose to offer severance pay to employees who are terminated, usually involuntarily. The primary reasons for offering a severance package are to help employees who are laid off or affected by a retrenchment or restructuring exercise taken by the company.\nDisputes arising from severance agreements may be due to aggrieved employees not wanting to leave the company and not ready to enter into unemployment.\nThe most common dispute, however, is regarding the compensation amount or the severance pay. For example, employees may demand that the compensation package comprises more benefits, such as an increased payout. As MOM states that the prevailing norm is to pay a retrenchment benefit of between\n2 weeks to 1 month’s salary per year\nof service, depending on the company’s financial position and the industry. Employers should do their best to assist the affected employees when offering a severance package, especially if the company is in a good financial position.\nMOM also encourages employers to help affected employees look for alternative jobs as part of the severance package. This may include helping employees look for jobs in associate companies, or through outplacement assistance programmes such as job fairs and career fairs. Employers who are intending to retrench workers and retrenched employees should refer to MOM’s\nwebsite\nfor advice.\n6) Non-compete clauses\nA non-compete clause may be found in your employment contract stating that you may not engage in business in certain markets and/or geographies for a certain period of time, often from the point when you join and/or leave the company. For example, a non-compete clause may state that the employee is not allowed to work with a competing company in the same industry for 5 years after they end their employment with their current employer. It is most frequently used in the finance and tech industries, largely due to the highly sensitive nature of the work and the importance of cultivating strong trade connections.\nDisputes arising from non-compete clauses typically center around the enforceability of these clauses. For example, an ex-employee at company A may have secured a position at a rival company, B, shortly after leaving company A. If the employee had a non-compete clause in his employment contract but wishes to work at company B, he may claim that the clause is unenforceable.\nWhile employers are entitled to include such clauses in their employment contracts, these clauses are usually not enforceable in Singapore. Whether such clauses are enforceable will depend on 2 factors:\nThe non-compete clause has to protect a “legitimate proprietary interest” of the employer; and\nThe scope of the non-compete clause is reasonable\nWhere the employee had access to the company’s trade secret or confidential information, the non-compete clause may be enforceable if it is of a reasonable scope. For example, where there is a high chance that the employee could easily divert business away from the company using the confidential information he had acquired during his employment, the non-compete clause may be enforceable.\nEmployees should be aware of the non-compete clause they are entering into and be prepared to commit to it should they agree to it. Employers should be mindful of the enforceability of such clauses and should ensure it is reasonable if they wish to include a non-compete clause.\nFor a more detailed discussion, you may refer to this article on the\nenforceability of non-compete clauses in Singapore\n.\nWhere Can I Get Help in the Event of an Employment Dispute?\nTADM and ECT\nThe type of assistance or legal recourse that can be sought would depend on the nature of the dispute. Generally, employers and employees can direct their queries and/or seek advice from Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM).\nWhere parties cannot come to a conclusion among themselves, they may file a mediation request with the TADM\n. TADM will facilitate the mediation to reach an amicable and fair resolution between the employees and employers. The parties’ legal and contractual obligations will be discussed, defined and drafted into a settlement agreement, which will be legally binding on all parties. The settlement agreement will state the terms parties agreed upon, which may include a compensation amount and/or an undertaking by the employer to fulfil certain obligations.\nIf the dispute is still unresolved at mediation, parties may file a claim with the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) and attend a case management conference to resolve the dispute. An ECT hearing may take place if parties are still unable to resolve their dispute. During the hearing, both the employer and employee can present their case. Upon which, the Tribunal Magistrate will make an order which may include dismissing the claim, ordering the employer to award the employee compensation for wrongful dismissal, reinstating the employee, etc.\nTAFEP\nFor matters regarding workplace discrimination, harassment and/or unfair practices, aggrieved employees may file a complaint with TAFEP by filling in an\nonline form\n. A TAFEP officer will contact you to follow up on the details of the incident.\nTAFEP will then approach the employer to put in place fair employment practices and ensure that there are no further discriminatory practices. TAFEP can also report discriminatory practices to MOM for further investigations. The organisation will be penalised accordingly should there be any lapses or unfair practices found.\nMOM\nAggrieved employees may also report employment infringements through MOM’s 24-hour online service. MOM oversees and investigates reports of employment infringement. These include violations of the Employment Act or workplace safety lapses. Appropriate action will then be taken against the offending employer.\nOn issues of workplace discrimination and unfair practices, employees may report them to MOM and these firms may be placed on the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Watchlist. Employers placed on the FCF Watchlist will have their work pass applications more closely scrutinised for any discriminatory hiring practices and will receive guidance from TAFEP to improve their HR practices\n.\nShould employees disagree with the retrenchment benefits they are given, they may raise them with MOM through the Labour Relations Department. MOM may, on a case-by-case basis, look at the financial state of the company, among other factors, to assess if it is capable of paying a higher severance pay\n.\nYou may refer to our other article\nfor a comprehensive list of\nwhere to seek help in the event of an employment dispute\n. Generally, employees and employers may request for mediation or seek advice from TADM in the event that the dispute cannot be resolved. It is also advisable to consult an employment lawyer at first instance for an assessment of the case or matter at hand and seek advice on the best way forward.\n—\nEmployers should try their best to ensure healthy relationships in the workplace and a safe workplace for all to prevent disputes.\nEmployees and employers alike should\nconsult an employment lawyer\nfor legal advice/assistance and to better assess their rights in relation to any employment contract or workplace dispute. You may also seek advice from\nTADM\nor\nTAFEP\nfor further guidance and/or advice on employment-related matters. Employers may additionally refer to MOM’s\nwebsite\nfor guidance on good employment practices.\nAlternatively, you can\nbook a phone consultation with an experienced employment dispute lawyer\n.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

The contract must include key employment terms and essential clauses pertaining to employment. These include an employee’s work hours, salary, leave benefits and job scope.

The contract can be terminated when the employee resigns, the employer dismisses the employee, or if the contract terms have expired.\nIn the case where the employer dismisses the employee, the employer has to give notice of the dismissal. The notice period will then have to be served before the employee can be dismissed. The notice period will typically be stipulated in the employment contract or will otherwise depend on the length of employment. For example, if the notice period is 30 calendar days, the employee can only be effectively dismissed 30 calendar days after he/she has been notified of his/her dismissal.\nThe dismissal will amount to a wrongful dismissal if the employee was dismissed without just or sufficient cause, as explained below.\nTermination/dismissal without just or sufficient cause\nUnder the Employment Act, dismissing an employee without just or sufficient cause (i.e. without a valid reason) is wrongful. Generally, a ‘just or sufficient cause’ would include the employee acting dishonestly, employee conduct that demonstrates gross negligence or frequently being absent from work.\nThe only exception for dismissal without notice under the Employment Act is on the grounds of the employee’s misconduct. Misconduct includes but is not limited to theft, dishonest or disorderly conduct at work, insubordination, and bringing the organisation into disrepute. However, a dispute may arise where the employer dismisses an employee on the grounds of misconduct, but the employee wishes to dispute the allegation.\nIf the employer alleges misconduct, the employer\nmust conduct a due inquiry\nbefore dismissing the employee on this ground. Failure to conduct such an inquiry will also amount to a wrongful dismissal.\nAn example where an employee may be dismissed on the grounds of misconduct is as follows: The employee handbook states that employees are not allowed to steal any of the company’s property. The employee was found to have stolen one of the company’s laptops for personal use. The company conducts a due inquiry, allowing the employee to explain why they had done so. If the employee is not able to justify their actions, they may be dismissed without notice on the ground of misconduct. This would not be a case of wrongful dismissal.\nHowever, if the employee was not allowed to explain his case or it was found that the employee was given permission from a superior to use the company’s laptop for their personal use during their employment, their behaviour might not amount to misconduct. If the employee was dismissed without notice under these circumstances, this would amount to a wrongful dismissal.\nOther grounds of wrongful termination/dismissal\nWhere an employer dismisses an employee on the following grounds, it will amount to a wrongful dismissal, even if notice was given to the employee:\nDismissal on\ndiscriminatory grounds\n(e.g., age, race, gender religion etc.)\nDismissal to\ndeprive an employee of benefits or entitlements\n(e.g., to deprive an employee of her maternity benefits, leave entitlements etc.)\nDismissal to\npunish an employee for exercising an employment right\n(e.g., dismissal after employee submitted a request to authorities for salary-related claims)\nA dispute between an employee and employer may arise if the employee believes they have been dismissed on discriminatory grounds. For example, the employer dismisses the employee with notice and no reason was given. However, the employee observed that the employer had made multiple discriminatory comments about the employee’s race and culture, casually stating that he prefers to hire someone of his race instead. The employer’s comments were heard by other employees.\nIn such a situation, the employer had taken a discriminatory attitude towards the employee, and the employer might have dismissed the employee on discriminatory grounds. This would amount to a wrongful dismissal.\nFor more information, you may refer to this guide on\nwrongful dismissal in Singapore\n.\n2) Wage-related disputes\nMost employment contracts will state the prescribed pay structure, giving employees certainty on when they will be paid and the amount to be paid. Pay structures can be on an hourly basis or a monthly basis, depending on the terms of the employment contract. However, there may be situations where employees find that they have not been paid their salary due to them or have not been paid on time. In these circumstances, there are many types of disputes that may arise.\nFor example, a part-time employee may realise upon calculation that his/her salary payment did not include the promised pay rate for working on a public holiday. A dispute may occur when the employee raises this issue to the employer, and the employer disagrees with the calculation. In such a situation, both parties should discuss what was agreed upon. The employee can show proof of the promised rate, if any. If both parties are not able to agree on a specified rate, they should refer to MOM’s website for the\nstandard public holiday pay rate.\nAnother example is if the employer withholds the employee’s salary for month X because the employee failed to meet his/her performance targets for that month. A dispute may arise if the employee asks to be paid despite failing to meet the targets and the employer refuses. According to the Employment Act, the employer must pay the employee’s salary once a month\n. However, if the employment contract stipulates how and when commission is to be paid, payment of the commission would depend on the terms of the employment contract or existing policies or practices. In such a situation, it is likely that the employer will have to pay the employee his/her basic salary, but may be entitled to withhold any commission if it is in accordance with the terms of the employment contract or the company’s policies.\nEmployers and employees alike should be aware of the company’s policies with regard to wages, and ensure that they do not contradict any statutory provisions in the Employment Act.\nFor more details and information on wage-related disputes, you may refer to this article on\nemployee salary\n.\n3) Workplace harassment\nWorkplace harassment can occur when someone at the workplace acts in a way that causes, or is likely to cause you to feel harassed, distressed or alarmed. This includes, but is not limited to, the following acts:\nVerbal abuse (e.g threatening, insulting language used, cyberbullying, or non-verbal gestures)\nPhysical abuse (e.g being pushed, slapped, or punched by a colleague or employer)\nStalking\nSexual harassment\nFor example, A and B are colleagues working together in the same team and in close proximity with one another. A loudly and repeatedly talks about A’s intention to have a sexual relationship with B to other co-workers in an explicit and insulting manner, knowing that B can hear this. This causes B to feel very distressed. Such conduct would therefore amount to workplace harassment.\nUsing the above example, disputes in the workplace may arise if B has brought up B’s discomfort to the company and they dismiss B’s concerns or do not deal with it appropriately. For instance, B raises concerns about A’s comments and behaviour to their organisation’s Human Resources department and requests to be assigned to a different team from A. If the company simply dismisses B’s concerns without conducting any investigation into A’s behaviour and B has to continue working in close proximity with A, B may have ground to take action against the company for not creating a safe working environment.\nEmployers should ensure that they are well-equipped and prepared to handle such situations swiftly and in a sensitive manner. Some best practices that employers should have in place include:\nA procedure where employees can report incidents of harassment;\nAn independent and impartial body to review such incidents;\nAssistance and closure provided to the victim; and\nPunishment or counselling for the harasser.\nEmployers can refer to the\nTripartite Advisory on Managing Workplace Harassment\nfor more information on best practices it should follow.\nEmployees should also be familiar with workplace harassment-related procedures in the organisation. Generally, employees should be able to report the matter to the Human Resource (HR) department and an internal investigation should be conducted. If the victim feels that their safety is still at risk, they should file a police report. Do note that harassment within and outside the workplace can also be an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA).\nEmployees and employers alike should check with their respective organisations on the relevant procedures and policies in place. For more details and information, please refer to this article on\nworkplace abuse and possible remedies in Singapore\n.\n4) Workplace discrimination\nWorkplace discrimination occurs when the employee is being discriminated against or treated unfairly due to factors like the employee’s age, gender, race, religion, language, marital status and family responsibility, disability\n.\nDisputes may arise if employers deny employees opportunities or treat them unfairly due to the factors mentioned above. For example, employers should not make snide remarks about nor ban religious headcovers in the workplace if it does not pose any safety risks. Female employees who are pregnant should also not be denied work opportunities or be passed on for job promotions simply because they have to take maternity leave after giving birth.\nThe Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness (Tripartite Committee) released an interim report in February 2023 which proposed new laws and rules to protect workers from discrimination.These include protecting workers from discrimination based on age, nationality, sex, marital status, pregnancy status, caregiving responsibilities, race, religion, language, disability and mental health conditions.\nA more detailed discussion can be found in our other article on the\nNew Proposed Discrimination Laws in Singapore\n.\nCurrently, employers are expected to abide by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP Guidelines), to recruit and select employees based on merit, to treat employees fairly, provide employees with equal opportunity, reward employees fairly and to abide by labour laws. If employees feel that they are denied opportunities or rewards simply due to any of the factors mentioned above, they may raise an issue with the employer.\nFor more information on discrimination in hiring practices, employers may refer to this article on\ndiscriminatory hiring practices in Singapore\n.\n5) Severance agreements\nA severance agreement outlines the financial terms on which the employee will be terminated. Severance pay is often offered as part of the terms of the severance agreement, in exchange for an employee’s release of their claims against the employer. Employees who have served the company for at least 2 years are eligible for severance pay, along with other retrenchment benefits. Those with less than 2 years’ service could be paid a severance pay out of the company’s goodwill.\nEmployers may choose to offer severance pay to employees who are terminated, usually involuntarily. The primary reasons for offering a severance package are to help employees who are laid off or affected by a retrenchment or restructuring exercise taken by the company.\nDisputes arising from severance agreements may be due to aggrieved employees not wanting to leave the company and not ready to enter into unemployment.\nThe most common dispute, however, is regarding the compensation amount or the severance pay. For example, employees may demand that the compensation package comprises more benefits, such as an increased payout. As MOM states that the prevailing norm is to pay a retrenchment benefit of between\n2 weeks to 1 month’s salary per year\nof service, depending on the company’s financial position and the industry. Employers should do their best to assist the affected employees when offering a severance package, especially if the company is in a good financial position.\nMOM also encourages employers to help affected employees look for alternative jobs as part of the severance package. This may include helping employees look for jobs in associate companies, or through outplacement assistance programmes such as job fairs and career fairs. Employers who are intending to retrench workers and retrenched employees should refer to MOM’s\nwebsite\nfor advice.\n6) Non-compete clauses\nA non-compete clause may be found in your employment contract stating that you may not engage in business in certain markets and/or geographies for a certain period of time, often from the point when you join and/or leave the company. For example, a non-compete clause may state that the employee is not allowed to work with a competing company in the same industry for 5 years after they end their employment with their current employer. It is most frequently used in the finance and tech industries, largely due to the highly sensitive nature of the work and the importance of cultivating strong trade connections.\nDisputes arising from non-compete clauses typically center around the enforceability of these clauses. For example, an ex-employee at company A may have secured a position at a rival company, B, shortly after leaving company A. If the employee had a non-compete clause in his employment contract but wishes to work at company B, he may claim that the clause is unenforceable.\nWhile employers are entitled to include such clauses in their employment contracts, these clauses are usually not enforceable in Singapore. Whether such clauses are enforceable will depend on 2 factors:\nThe non-compete clause has to protect a “legitimate proprietary interest” of the employer; and\nThe scope of the non-compete clause is reasonable\nWhere the employee had access to the company’s trade secret or confidential information, the non-compete clause may be enforceable if it is of a reasonable scope. For example, where there is a high chance that the employee could easily divert business away from the company using the confidential information he had acquired during his employment, the non-compete clause may be enforceable.\nEmployees should be aware of the non-compete clause they are entering into and be prepared to commit to it should they agree to it. Employers should be mindful of the enforceability of such clauses and should ensure it is reasonable if they wish to include a non-compete clause.\nFor a more detailed discussion, you may refer to this article on the\nenforceability of non-compete clauses in Singapore\n.\nWhere Can I Get Help in the Event of an Employment Dispute?\nTADM and ECT\nThe type of assistance or legal recourse that can be sought would depend on the nature of the dispute. Generally, employers and employees can direct their queries and/or seek advice from Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM).\nWhere parties cannot come to a conclusion among themselves, they may file a mediation request with the TADM\n. TADM will facilitate the mediation to reach an amicable and fair resolution between the employees and employers. The parties’ legal and contractual obligations will be discussed, defined and drafted into a settlement agreement, which will be legally binding on all parties. The settlement agreement will state the terms parties agreed upon, which may include a compensation amount and/or an undertaking by the employer to fulfil certain obligations.\nIf the dispute is still unresolved at mediation, parties may file a claim with the Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) and attend a case management conference to resolve the dispute. An ECT hearing may take place if parties are still unable to resolve their dispute. During the hearing, both the employer and employee can present their case. Upon which, the Tribunal Magistrate will make an order which may include dismissing the claim, ordering the employer to award the employee compensation for wrongful dismissal, reinstating the employee, etc.\nTAFEP\nFor matters regarding workplace discrimination, harassment and/or unfair practices, aggrieved employees may file a complaint with TAFEP by filling in an\nonline form\n. A TAFEP officer will contact you to follow up on the details of the incident.\nTAFEP will then approach the employer to put in place fair employment practices and ensure that there are no further discriminatory practices. TAFEP can also report discriminatory practices to MOM for further investigations. The organisation will be penalised accordingly should there be any lapses or unfair practices found.\nMOM\nAggrieved employees may also report employment infringements through MOM’s 24-hour online service. MOM oversees and investigates reports of employment infringement. These include violations of the Employment Act or workplace safety lapses. Appropriate action will then be taken against the offending employer.\nOn issues of workplace discrimination and unfair practices, employees may report them to MOM and these firms may be placed on the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) Watchlist. Employers placed on the FCF Watchlist will have their work pass applications more closely scrutinised for any discriminatory hiring practices and will receive guidance from TAFEP to improve their HR practices\n.\nShould employees disagree with the retrenchment benefits they are given, they may raise them with MOM through the Labour Relations Department. MOM may, on a case-by-case basis, look at the financial state of the company, among other factors, to assess if it is capable of paying a higher severance pay\n.\nYou may refer to our other article\nfor a comprehensive list of\nwhere to seek help in the event of an employment dispute\n. Generally, employees and employers may request for mediation or seek advice from TADM in the event that the dispute cannot be resolved. It is also advisable to consult an employment lawyer at first instance for an assessment of the case or matter at hand and seek advice on the best way forward.\n—\nEmployers should try their best to ensure healthy relationships in the workplace and a safe workplace for all to prevent disputes.\nEmployees and employers alike should\nconsult an employment lawyer\nfor legal advice/assistance and to better assess their rights in relation to any employment contract or workplace dispute. You may also seek advice from\nTADM\nor\nTAFEP\nfor further guidance and/or advice on employment-related matters. Employers may additionally refer to MOM’s\nwebsite\nfor guidance on good employment practices.\nAlternatively, you can\nbook a phone consultation with an experienced employment dispute lawyer\n.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

My Job Offer Got Rescinded, What Can I Do?", "text": "Help! My Job Offer Got Rescinded, What Can I Do?\nLast updated on December 19, 2022\nAmidst an increasingly competitive job market, stable and secure employment continues to be valued for the socioeconomic assurances it promises. Thus, receiving a job offer to pursue a career in your desired field would seem to be something to be celebrated. However, it appears that even prospective employees who have completed the intensive process of interviews and assessments to secure a job offer continue to have a reason for concern.\nThis was the case for Lingo (not his real name), a Chinese national who packed up his life in China and spent S$14,000 to move to Singapore upon accepting an offer to join Shopee, a Singaporean multinational technology company, as an algorithm engineer.\nHowever, upon arriving in Singapore and days before starting his new job, Lingo was informed by Shopee that the job offer had been rescinded.\nThis article will explain the potential reasons for, and legal implications of, an employer rescinding a job offer in Singapore. It will cover:\nWhat It Means to Have Your Job Offer Rescinded\nA rescinded job offer refers to a situation where an employer who had previously extended a job offer to a prospective employee later withdraws the offer. Employers may rescind an offer for various reasons and under various circumstances (as explained below).\nWhy Might an Employer Rescind Their Job Offer?\nDifferent factors can influence an employer’s decision to rescind a job offer. In the case of Shopee, their reason for rescinding Lingo’s job offer was due to “adjustments to hiring plans on some tech teams”.\nSome other reasons may include the following:\nUnprofessional conduct\nIf you tried to negotiate a salary that the employer is not amenable to after initially accepting their offer\nIf you have posted or made public statements that do not align with their mission and values\nFinancial challenges of the company\nWhere the company is suffering financial issues and determines it necessary to reduce costs\nOffer expiration\nIf you failed to accept the offer before it lapses without providing valid reasons for doing so, and the employer gives the position to another candidate\nFailed background checks\nIf you are found to have lied about your criminal record, bankruptcy status, or other matters relevant to your role\nNegative employment reference\nIf your employer receives negative feedback upon reaching out to your references on matters concerning your job history, skills, competencies and personality traits, they may feel that you are not an ideal fit for their position\nActive non-compete agreement\nIf you had signed a\nnon-compete agreement\nwith your former or current employer that is still in force, a new company in the same industry may revoke your offer so as to avoid incurring any penalties for breaching the agreement\nInaccurate application information\nIf you have not been honest about certain details in your resume or application, the employer may rescind the offer after verifying such information which may include your education, skills, former positions of responsibility, and achievements\nChange in leadership\nin the company\nA change in the company’s management may affect the previous management’s recruitment decisions, such as the hiring process and prospective candidates for the role\nIs It Legal For a Singapore Employer to Rescind a Job Offer?\nUnder Singapore law, whether an employer may legally rescind a job offer largely depends on the circumstances surrounding the initial job offer. In particular, it is important to distinguish the situations in which there was a signed employment contract concluded between yourself and your employer, and where no employment contract was present.\nWhere there is a signed employment contract\nEmployers may not legally rescind or revoke a previously offered job if there is a signed employment contract. This is because an employment contract essentially constitutes an agreement between the employer and employee, and they are bound to certain contractual obligations as stipulated in the terms. Likewise, where there is a signed contract of service between the employer and employee, rescinding a job offer can constitute a termination of the contract. Under the Employment Act (EA), any termination must be done in accordance with the terms of the contract.\nIf there is an employment contract, the employer must also abide by the notice period stipulated therein. If an employee’s employment is terminated while serving their probationary period, which is typically between three to six months, then the affected employee would need to serve at least one week’s notice.\nWhere the employment contract does not provide for a termination notice period, the employer must issue a notice period in accordance with\nSection 10 of the EA\n. Likewise, an employer must observe one day’s notice for employees who have worked less than 26 weeks.\nYou may refer to the\nguidelines\nprovided by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for further information on the recommended practice for employment termination. For additional information, you may also refer to our\nother article\non the\nprocesses following the termination of employment\n.\nShould your employer fail to comply with the terms and conditions under the employment contract, including the notice period, your employer can be liable for compensation in the form of payment in lieu of notice.\nWhere your employer seeks to rescind your job offer, thereby effectively terminating your employment, you must also be issued a termination letter in writing and it must be signed by yourself as well as your employer. If you do not receive a termination letter, you should request it from your employer. If a termination letter is not issued, the employment contract will remain valid notwithstanding your employer’s attempt to rescind the job offer.\nWhere there is no signed employment contract\nConversely, where there is no signed employment contract between yourself and your employer, it will not be possible for you to seek legal recourse against your employer. This is because the lack of contractual obligations binding your employer in relation to your job offer provides you without a legal basis for disputing their decision or for seeking a remedy.\nWhat Can You Do If Your Job Offer has been Rescinded?\nIn the unfortunate event that your job offer is rescinded, you may be wondering whether there are any avenues through which you can dispute your employer’s decision or seek any form of remedy. This section will address some practical measures and legal options that may be available to you in this regard.\nFind out the reasons for your job offer being rescinded\nIf your employer has complied with the notice period requirement as stipulated in the signed employment contract or under the EA, your employer is not required to give a reason for rescinding the job offer. However, should you still wish to be informed of the reason behind their decision, it is recommended that you reach out to the company’s management or Human Resources department.\nSubsequently, should you have any reason to suspect that the job offer was rescinded on potentially discriminatory grounds (e.g. including for reasons of gender, pregnancy, or religion), you may be able to seek advice from MOM or the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) as these are contrary to fair hiring practices in Singapore. Further information on TAFEP’s guidelines may be found\nhere\n.\nEmployers who fail to abide by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices will face scrutiny from MOM. Such employers also risk having their work pass privileges curtailed, for instance, by being debarred from making and renewing work pass applications.\nCan you take legal action against the company?\nIf you have already signed the employment contract and your employer subsequently rescinded the job offer, whether you may seek any viable legal action against your employer would depend on the circumstances around such termination. These are further explained below.\nWhere the employment contract provides for the employer’s right to rescind a job offer\nWhere the employer is contractually entitled to rescind the job offer, for instance by terminating the employment contract with notice, such termination will be presumed not to be wrongful.\nIn order to establish a case of wrongful dismissal, you must be able to substantiate a wrongful reason for the dismissal. Absent a valid reason, you will not be able to succeed in a claim for wrongful dismissal. Some examples of wrongful reasons for dismissing an employee include the following:\nDiscrimination\nDismissing an employee for his or her age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.\nDepriving an employee of a benefit\nDismissing an employee soon after she informs her employer of her pregnancy to deprive her of her maternity benefits.\nDismissing an employee soon before his or her retirement so as to avoid disbursing retirement benefits they would otherwise have been entitled to.\nPunishing an employee for exercising his rights as an employee\nDismissing an employee for declining a request to work overtime.\nDismissing an employee for filing a mediation request to resolve a workplace dispute with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management.\nFurther elaborations and examples of wrongful dismissals may be found\nhere\n.\nBesides the above reasons, a dismissal would also be considered wrongful where the employer’s given reason for dismissal with notice is proven to be false.\nWhere the prospective employee has incurred expenses in expectation of starting the job\nIn the event that the employee has relocated his family or moved his residence to be nearer to the workplace as was the case with Lingo, the availability of legal recourse would depend on the terms of the job offer signed between the employer and prospective employee.\nIf the employment contract includes a termination provision detailing the rights and obligations of both parties regarding the termination of employment, the employer may be bound to discharge additional obligations and comply with additional conditions in the event that they choose to rescind a job offer. For instance, where the termination clause provides that the prospective employee is entitled to payment in lieu of notice or to compensation for any expenses incurred in reliance of the job offered, they would be bound to comply with the clause in the manner and extent as prescribed.\nInsofar as the potential of commencing legal action against your employer’s decision to rescind a job offer is concerned, this would not be prudent given the time and costs involved in litigation. MOM has therefore recommended that employers and employees involved in such situations should “work out an amicable way to resolve the matter in good faith.”\nThis can be through an informal negotiation or mediation with an independent third party.\nWhere your employer is not forthcoming with reaching a peaceful resolution, you may wish to consider consulting an employment lawyer on the appropriate course of action to take before engaging in further attempts to resolve the matter through legal or other means.\nIn the unfortunate event that your job offer is rescinded, you should carefully review the terms of any employment contract or agreement that you may have signed with your prospective employer.\n—\nThe discussion above offers a brief overview of the various situations that may arise in relation to a rescinded job offer as well as the legal options that may be available to you. However, as each matter can depend on the specific circumstances and terms of your employment contract, it is best to consult an\nemployment lawyer\n. An employment lawyer will be able to offer you further advice, help determine your rights, and assess any possible avenues for legal recourse.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Thus, receiving a job offer to pursue a career in your desired field would seem to be something to be celebrated. However, it appears that even prospective employees who have completed the intensive process of interviews and assessments to secure a job offer continue to have a reason for concern.\nThis was the case for Lingo (not his real name), a Chinese national who packed up his life in China and spent S$14,000 to move to Singapore upon accepting an offer to join Shopee, a Singaporean multinational technology company, as an algorithm engineer.\nHowever, upon arriving in Singapore and days before starting his new job, Lingo was informed by Shopee that the job offer had been rescinded.\nThis article will explain the potential reasons for, and legal implications of, an employer rescinding a job offer in Singapore. It will cover:\nWhat It Means to Have Your Job Offer Rescinded\nA rescinded job offer refers to a situation where an employer who had previously extended a job offer to a prospective employee later withdraws the offer. Employers may rescind an offer for various reasons and under various circumstances (as explained below).\nWhy Might an Employer Rescind Their Job Offer?\nDifferent factors can influence an employer’s decision to rescind a job offer. In the case of Shopee, their reason for rescinding Lingo’s job offer was due to “adjustments to hiring plans on some tech teams”.\nSome other reasons may include the following:\nUnprofessional conduct\nIf you tried to negotiate a salary that the employer is not amenable to after initially accepting their offer\nIf you have posted or made public statements that do not align with their mission and values\nFinancial challenges of the company\nWhere the company is suffering financial issues and determines it necessary to reduce costs\nOffer expiration\nIf you failed to accept the offer before it lapses without providing valid reasons for doing so, and the employer gives the position to another candidate\nFailed background checks\nIf you are found to have lied about your criminal record, bankruptcy status, or other matters relevant to your role\nNegative employment reference\nIf your employer receives negative feedback upon reaching out to your references on matters concerning your job history, skills, competencies and personality traits, they may feel that you are not an ideal fit for their position\nActive non-compete agreement\nIf you had signed a\nnon-compete agreement\nwith your former or current employer that is still in force, a new company in the same industry may revoke your offer so as to avoid incurring any penalties for breaching the agreement\nInaccurate application information\nIf you have not been honest about certain details in your resume or application, the employer may rescind the offer after verifying such information which may include your education, skills, former positions of responsibility, and achievements\nChange in leadership\nin the company\nA change in the company’s management may affect the previous management’s recruitment decisions, such as the hiring process and prospective candidates for the role\nIs It Legal For a Singapore Employer to Rescind a Job Offer?\nUnder Singapore law, whether an employer may legally rescind a job offer largely depends on the circumstances surrounding the initial job offer. In particular, it is important to distinguish the situations in which there was a signed employment contract concluded between yourself and your employer, and where no employment contract was present.\nWhere there is a signed employment contract\nEmployers may not legally rescind or revoke a previously offered job if there is a signed employment contract. This is because an employment contract essentially constitutes an agreement between the employer and employee, and they are bound to certain contractual obligations as stipulated in the terms. Likewise, where there is a signed contract of service between the employer and employee, rescinding a job offer can constitute a termination of the contract. Under the Employment Act (EA), any termination must be done in accordance with the terms of the contract.\nIf there is an employment contract, the employer must also abide by the notice period stipulated therein. If an employee’s employment is terminated while serving their probationary period, which is typically between three to six months, then the affected employee would need to serve at least one week’s notice.\nWhere the employment contract does not provide for a termination notice period, the employer must issue a notice period in accordance with\nSection 10 of the EA\n. Likewise, an employer must observe one day’s notice for employees who have worked less than 26 weeks.\nYou may refer to the\nguidelines\nprovided by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for further information on the recommended practice for employment termination. For additional information, you may also refer to our\nother article\non the\nprocesses following the termination of employment\n.\nShould your employer fail to comply with the terms and conditions under the employment contract, including the notice period, your employer can be liable for compensation in the form of payment in lieu of notice.\nWhere your employer seeks to rescind your job offer, thereby effectively terminating your employment, you must also be issued a termination letter in writing and it must be signed by yourself as well as your employer. If you do not receive a termination letter, you should request it from your employer. If a termination letter is not issued, the employment contract will remain valid notwithstanding your employer’s attempt to rescind the job offer.\nWhere there is no signed employment contract\nConversely, where there is no signed employment contract between yourself and your employer, it will not be possible for you to seek legal recourse against your employer. This is because the lack of contractual obligations binding your employer in relation to your job offer provides you without a legal basis for disputing their decision or for seeking a remedy.\nWhat Can You Do If Your Job Offer has been Rescinded?\nIn the unfortunate event that your job offer is rescinded, you may be wondering whether there are any avenues through which you can dispute your employer’s decision or seek any form of remedy. This section will address some practical measures and legal options that may be available to you in this regard.\nFind out the reasons for your job offer being rescinded\nIf your employer has complied with the notice period requirement as stipulated in the signed employment contract or under the EA, your employer is not required to give a reason for rescinding the job offer. However, should you still wish to be informed of the reason behind their decision, it is recommended that you reach out to the company’s management or Human Resources department.\nSubsequently, should you have any reason to suspect that the job offer was rescinded on potentially discriminatory grounds (e.g. including for reasons of gender, pregnancy, or religion), you may be able to seek advice from MOM or the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) as these are contrary to fair hiring practices in Singapore. Further information on TAFEP’s guidelines may be found\nhere\n.\nEmployers who fail to abide by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices will face scrutiny from MOM. Such employers also risk having their work pass privileges curtailed, for instance, by being debarred from making and renewing work pass applications.\nCan you take legal action against the company?\nIf you have already signed the employment contract and your employer subsequently rescinded the job offer, whether you may seek any viable legal action against your employer would depend on the circumstances around such termination. These are further explained below.\nWhere the employment contract provides for the employer’s right to rescind a job offer\nWhere the employer is contractually entitled to rescind the job offer, for instance by terminating the employment contract with notice, such termination will be presumed not to be wrongful.\nIn order to establish a case of wrongful dismissal, you must be able to substantiate a wrongful reason for the dismissal. Absent a valid reason, you will not be able to succeed in a claim for wrongful dismissal. Some examples of wrongful reasons for dismissing an employee include the following:\nDiscrimination\nDismissing an employee for his or her age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities, or disability.\nDepriving an employee of a benefit\nDismissing an employee soon after she informs her employer of her pregnancy to deprive her of her maternity benefits.\nDismissing an employee soon before his or her retirement so as to avoid disbursing retirement benefits they would otherwise have been entitled to.\nPunishing an employee for exercising his rights as an employee\nDismissing an employee for declining a request to work overtime.\nDismissing an employee for filing a mediation request to resolve a workplace dispute with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management.\nFurther elaborations and examples of wrongful dismissals may be found\nhere\n.\nBesides the above reasons, a dismissal would also be considered wrongful where the employer’s given reason for dismissal with notice is proven to be false.\nWhere the prospective employee has incurred expenses in expectation of starting the job\nIn the event that the employee has relocated his family or moved his residence to be nearer to the workplace as was the case with Lingo, the availability of legal recourse would depend on the terms of the job offer signed between the employer and prospective employee.\nIf the employment contract includes a termination provision detailing the rights and obligations of both parties regarding the termination of employment, the employer may be bound to discharge additional obligations and comply with additional conditions in the event that they choose to rescind a job offer. For instance, where the termination clause provides that the prospective employee is entitled to payment in lieu of notice or to compensation for any expenses incurred in reliance of the job offered, they would be bound to comply with the clause in the manner and extent as prescribed.\nInsofar as the potential of commencing legal action against your employer’s decision to rescind a job offer is concerned, this would not be prudent given the time and costs involved in litigation. MOM has therefore recommended that employers and employees involved in such situations should “work out an amicable way to resolve the matter in good faith.”\nThis can be through an informal negotiation or mediation with an independent third party.\nWhere your employer is not forthcoming with reaching a peaceful resolution, you may wish to consider consulting an employment lawyer on the appropriate course of action to take before engaging in further attempts to resolve the matter through legal or other means.\nIn the unfortunate event that your job offer is rescinded, you should carefully review the terms of any employment contract or agreement that you may have signed with your prospective employer.\n—\nThe discussion above offers a brief overview of the various situations that may arise in relation to a rescinded job offer as well as the legal options that may be available to you. However, as each matter can depend on the specific circumstances and terms of your employment contract, it is best to consult an\nemployment lawyer\n. An employment lawyer will be able to offer you further advice, help determine your rights, and assess any possible avenues for legal recourse.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

For many, work from home arrangements are now not just something that they have become used to, but also an expectation. However, without any laws in place directly regulating the implementation of flexible work arrangements, employees may be worried that they may suffer the consequences of raising a request for flexible work arrangements. These include whether their employers may cut their pay if they choose to work from home.\nUnder a new set of guidelines for such arrangements that will take effect from 2024, employers must consider their employees’ requests for flexible work arrangements fairly and properly, but the question as to whether employers can legally cut their employees’ pay remains unclear.\nThis article will cover the following topics:\nWhat are Flexible Work Arrangements?\nFlexible work arrangements refer to work arrangements where employers and employees agree to vary the typical work arrangement of working a full-time job, with fixed hours and from a designated workplace.\nThese variations can be categorised into three main categories:\nFlexi-time arrangements\n: Such arrangements are centred around allowing employees to decide how best to schedule their time, within certain parameters prescribed by their employers. For example, requiring employees to work 40 hours a week but allowing them to decide to do so within a 4-day work week, allowing employees to stagger their start and end work hours, or contracting employees to work a certain number of hours per week, but allowing them the flexibility to work at any time of the day, provided they complete the stipulated hours.\nFlexi-load arrangements\n: Flexi-load arrangements refer to arrangements where employees are allowed to adjust and tailor their workloads according to their needs. For example, employers can provide for job sharing arrangements, where two or more part-time employees can share the responsibilities of one full-time employee, so that they can divide their responsibilities among themselves, or employers can engage employees for specific periods or certain projects only.\nFlexi-place arrangements\n: Such arrangements are most commonly referred to as work from home arrangements, and basically involve employees being allowed to telecommute, and work from a location other than the workplace.\nFlexible working arrangements really came to the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many companies were forced to transition to fully work from home arrangements.\nAs such, work from home became a norm for employees during the pandemic. As Singapore transitioned to living with COVID-19, and COVID-19 measures were gradually eased, many companies retained flexible work arrangements, to afford their\nemployees flexibility in work schedules, especially if they need to juggle caregiving/parenting responsibilities etc.\nWhat are the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements?\nThe Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangements (Guidelines) refers to a new set of guidelines released by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) in 2024.\nThe aim of the Guidelines is to provide a comprehensive framework to aid employers to implement flexible work arrangements. The main guidelines that will be introduced in the Guidelines include that:\nEmployers will be required to consider any and all requests from their employees for flexible work arrangements, and must do so fairly and properly. For example, an employee who needs to pick his/her child from school in the evenings may request for flexi-time work arrangements,\ni.e.\nto be allowed to start work earlier so that he/she can leave work earlier. The employer will have to at least consider the request, including assessing the potential advantages and disadvantages of granting the request.\nEmployers have the prerogative to grant or reject their employees’ requests, but must have valid reasons for their decision. This allows employers to take into consideration their business needs. For example, employers may reject an employee’s request for flexible work arrangements on the basis that the employee’s primary job scope is in machine maintenance, and flexible work arrangements would not be practical and/or may have significant resource implications.\nEmployers are encouraged to adopt the Tripartite Standards on Flexible Work Arrangements (Standards). However, adoption of the Standards is entirely up to the employers, and is not mandatory.\nThe Standards set out practices that employers should implement in order to help their employees better manage their work-life needs through flexible work options, and consists of five main recommendations:\nEmployers should offer flexible work arrangements to their employees.\nEmployers should appoint a member of the senior management to champion and promote flexible work arrangements.\nEmployees should be allowed to, and feel comfortable to, request for flexible work arrangements offered by their employers. This also means that employers should inform employees about the types of flexible work arrangements offered, the process to request for them, and the expectations of employees on the responsible use of flexible work arrangements. Such information can be made available on the intranet, human resources policy, or internal circulars.\nEmployers should evaluate and communicate the outcomes of employees’ flexible work arrangements applications promptly, and should ensure that they are well-documented. In the event a request is denied, employers should communicate the reasons to their employees and discuss appropriate alternatives where possible, to meet the needs of both the employer as well as the employee.\nEmployers should ensure that their staff in-charge of evaluating employees’ flexible work arrangements applications are well-trained to conduct such evaluations objectively, and also to set work expectations, manage and appraise employees on flexible work arrangements.\nThat said, employers who are keen to adopt the Standards and offer flexible work arrangements to their employees should still be mindful to comply with the Employment Act and relevant employment-related legislation in Singapore, such as the Personal Data Protection Act or the Work Injury Compensation Act. Employers should follow the following guidelines when implementing flexible work arrangements:\nEmployers should ensure that the flexible work arrangements offered and granted do not violate the terms and conditions set out in the Employment Act. For example, employees’ working hours should not exceed 8 hours daily or 44 hours weekly, and if employees are required to work overtime, they should be remunerated with overtime payment.\nEmployers should put in place measures to protect their employees’ personal data, so as to retain compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act. This is especially since with more employees working from home, the cybersecurity measures implemented by the company at the workplace may be less effective,\nwhich leaves personal data stored by the company more vulnerable to external attacks. Hence, employers should adopt measures such as keeping their data security software up to date and able to accommodate remote working setups, as well as conduct training for employees to increase their awareness of the cybersecurity risks from working remotely and how to deal with them.\nEmployers should provide a safe working environment, regardless of whether their employees are working at the workplace or remotely. The general health and safety requirements in the Workplace Safety and Health Act continue to apply to employees working from home.\nHence, employers should make it a point to communicate with their employees and conduct health and safety risk assessments of their employees’ remote working setups and take additional measures to mitigate any additional risks, including reconsidering and refining existing insurance policies. Employers should also reconsider the need to have a separate set of rules and regulations for remote working, so as to encourage safe working procedures at home.\nEmployers should ensure that the terms of the employment contract, including flexible work arrangements, are expressly stated in the contract and agreed upon by both parties.\nCan My Employer Cut My Pay If I Choose to Work From Home?\nAs an employee, you may be worried that your employer will cut your pay if you choose to work from home. Such concerns are not entirely unfounded, as many companies abroad have started doing so, or announced that they will be doing so. For example, in the US, large corporations like Google, Facebook and Twitter have cut the pay of employees who switch to working from home permanently.\nIn Singapore, it is an open question as to whether such a practice is legal or permitted, as there is no specific legislation addressing this. However, as mentioned above, employers still have to comply with the Employment Act and relevant employment-related legislation, which have certain safeguards in place. For example, the Employment Act requires employers to notify employees in writing of their key employment terms, including the terms surrounding the payment of their salaries.\nThis prevents employers from being able to unilaterally vary your pay on the basis of your choice to work from home.\nThe Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, also issued by TAFEP and which employers are expected to abide by, require employers to remunerate their employees fairly, taking into consideration factors such as their ability, performance, contribution, skills, knowledge and experience.\nArguably, this prevents employers from deducing your remuneration unfairly, if the only basis for doing so is that you have chosen to work from home instead of working from the workplace, assuming your work performance is unaffected.\nIn the event of a dispute over your salary, you can file a complaint with one of two authorities: Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) or the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). These organisations can investigate the complaint and take appropriate action.\nTo file a claim with TADM, you will need to complete an\nonline form\nwith your name and contact details. TADM can assist in the resolution of your complaint either by arranging for a mediation session with the assistance of a TADM mediator, or by providing advisory services to you on how to move forward with your complaint.\nMOM offers a 24-hour online service that allows you to report an employment infringement. Employment infringements refer to violations of the Employment Act, and cover areas like an employee’s salary, leave entitlements, public holidays entitlements, or working hours and rest days. After you file your complaint with MOM, you will be contacted by a MOM officer to verify your report and advise on the next steps. MOM can take certain actions against the offending employer, including revoking the work pass privileges of employers. Employers can also be fined upon conviction for offences under the Employment Act, such as for failing to pay salaries.\nHow Can I Discuss Working From Home With My Employer?\nIf your life priorities or needs require you to be able to work from home either permanently or partially, you should definitely consider having a discussion with your employer. However, in order to ensure that you maximise your chances of receiving a favourable reply from your employer, you should take note of the following points:\nYou should be aware of and properly think through the reasons why you need to be able to work from home. If possible, try to frame these reasons as being beneficial to not only yourself, but also your employer. It is important to remember that your employer may not be resistant to the idea of you working from home, but may simply be uncertain about, or afraid of, the impact that it may have on things like your work performance, your productivity, or the degree of control they will have over you. Hence, you can frame your reasons in a way that addresses some of these potential fears. For example, instead of saying that you prefer to work from home because of the long and exhausting commute to work, you may instead consider reframing your reason to be that you prefer to work from home so that you can get more rest in the morning, which would allow you to be more productive for the rest of the day.\nWhile it may be best for you to work from home permanently, consider making your request in stages (\ni.e.\nrequest to work from home for a certain number of days a week, and slowly increase that number from there). Doing so can help you get used to the transition from the routine of working at the workplace to the new normal of working from home. More importantly, this can also ease your employer into seeing that any fears that they may have had were unfounded, which would make it easier for you to achieve your target of working from home permanently in the near future.\nDepending on your occupation, one downside from working from home may be that your employer will have less direct oversight over your work performance. If this applies to you, it may be important to keep a record of the metrics that your employer may be interested to know, for example, how many hours you worked, the work/projects that you completed etc. This allows your employers to keep track of your work performance, and also to continually assess whether working from home is suitable. You can also schedule regular check-ins with your supervisor to assure him/her of your work performance.\nSome companies may already have a corporate work from home policy,\ni.e.\na set of company guidelines allowing employees to work from home, and covering matters such as employees’ eligibility for working from home as well as the responsibilities and expectations of both employers and employees while working from home.\nIf your employer has a corporate work from home policy in place, you should definitely go through the policy, as it will give you an insight as to what your employer is really looking out for, and is concerned about when it comes to implementing a work from home policy. This will allow you to equip yourself with the information needed to word your requests to work from home the right way, taking into account these concerns.\nFor a more detailed discussion on\nwhat employers consider when drafting a work from home policy for their employees\n, you can consult our other article on the topic.\n—\nIn conclusion, as working from home becomes the norm, employees and employers alike should bear in mind the latest employment-related legislation that applies to flexible work arrangements, including whether employers are entitled to reduce the remuneration of employees who choose to work from home.\nFor employees who need further tailored advice on flexible work arrangements, or disputes arising from flexible work arrangements, you should\ncontact an experienced employment lawyer\nor\nemployment disputes lawyer\nrespectively. Employment lawyers would be able to review your employment contract and advise you on your rights and obligations, as well as on your legal options in the event of a potential dispute.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

In the event a request is denied, employers should communicate the reasons to their employees and discuss appropriate alternatives where possible, to meet the needs of both the employer as well as the employee.\nEmployers should ensure that their staff in-charge of evaluating employees’ flexible work arrangements applications are well-trained to conduct such evaluations objectively, and also to set work expectations, manage and appraise employees on flexible work arrangements.\nThat said, employers who are keen to adopt the Standards and offer flexible work arrangements to their employees should still be mindful to comply with the Employment Act and relevant employment-related legislation in Singapore, such as the Personal Data Protection Act or the Work Injury Compensation Act. Employers should follow the following guidelines when implementing flexible work arrangements:\nEmployers should ensure that the flexible work arrangements offered and granted do not violate the terms and conditions set out in the Employment Act. For example, employees’ working hours should not exceed 8 hours daily or 44 hours weekly, and if employees are required to work overtime, they should be remunerated with overtime payment.\nEmployers should put in place measures to protect their employees’ personal data, so as to retain compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act. This is especially since with more employees working from home, the cybersecurity measures implemented by the company at the workplace may be less effective,\nwhich leaves personal data stored by the company more vulnerable to external attacks. Hence, employers should adopt measures such as keeping their data security software up to date and able to accommodate remote working setups, as well as conduct training for employees to increase their awareness of the cybersecurity risks from working remotely and how to deal with them.\nEmployers should provide a safe working environment, regardless of whether their employees are working at the workplace or remotely. The general health and safety requirements in the Workplace Safety and Health Act continue to apply to employees working from home.\nHence, employers should make it a point to communicate with their employees and conduct health and safety risk assessments of their employees’ remote working setups and take additional measures to mitigate any additional risks, including reconsidering and refining existing insurance policies. Employers should also reconsider the need to have a separate set of rules and regulations for remote working, so as to encourage safe working procedures at home.\nEmployers should ensure that the terms of the employment contract, including flexible work arrangements, are expressly stated in the contract and agreed upon by both parties.\nCan My Employer Cut My Pay If I Choose to Work From Home?\nAs an employee, you may be worried that your employer will cut your pay if you choose to work from home. Such concerns are not entirely unfounded, as many companies abroad have started doing so, or announced that they will be doing so. For example, in the US, large corporations like Google, Facebook and Twitter have cut the pay of employees who switch to working from home permanently.\nIn Singapore, it is an open question as to whether such a practice is legal or permitted, as there is no specific legislation addressing this. However, as mentioned above, employers still have to comply with the Employment Act and relevant employment-related legislation, which have certain safeguards in place. For example, the Employment Act requires employers to notify employees in writing of their key employment terms, including the terms surrounding the payment of their salaries.\nThis prevents employers from being able to unilaterally vary your pay on the basis of your choice to work from home.\nThe Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, also issued by TAFEP and which employers are expected to abide by, require employers to remunerate their employees fairly, taking into consideration factors such as their ability, performance, contribution, skills, knowledge and experience.\nArguably, this prevents employers from deducing your remuneration unfairly, if the only basis for doing so is that you have chosen to work from home instead of working from the workplace, assuming your work performance is unaffected.\nIn the event of a dispute over your salary, you can file a complaint with one of two authorities: Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) or the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). These organisations can investigate the complaint and take appropriate action.\nTo file a claim with TADM, you will need to complete an\nonline form\nwith your name and contact details. TADM can assist in the resolution of your complaint either by arranging for a mediation session with the assistance of a TADM mediator, or by providing advisory services to you on how to move forward with your complaint.\nMOM offers a 24-hour online service that allows you to report an employment infringement. Employment infringements refer to violations of the Employment Act, and cover areas like an employee’s salary, leave entitlements, public holidays entitlements, or working hours and rest days. After you file your complaint with MOM, you will be contacted by a MOM officer to verify your report and advise on the next steps. MOM can take certain actions against the offending employer, including revoking the work pass privileges of employers. Employers can also be fined upon conviction for offences under the Employment Act, such as for failing to pay salaries.\nHow Can I Discuss Working From Home With My Employer?\nIf your life priorities or needs require you to be able to work from home either permanently or partially, you should definitely consider having a discussion with your employer. However, in order to ensure that you maximise your chances of receiving a favourable reply from your employer, you should take note of the following points:\nYou should be aware of and properly think through the reasons why you need to be able to work from home. If possible, try to frame these reasons as being beneficial to not only yourself, but also your employer. It is important to remember that your employer may not be resistant to the idea of you working from home, but may simply be uncertain about, or afraid of, the impact that it may have on things like your work performance, your productivity, or the degree of control they will have over you. Hence, you can frame your reasons in a way that addresses some of these potential fears. For example, instead of saying that you prefer to work from home because of the long and exhausting commute to work, you may instead consider reframing your reason to be that you prefer to work from home so that you can get more rest in the morning, which would allow you to be more productive for the rest of the day.\nWhile it may be best for you to work from home permanently, consider making your request in stages (\ni.e.\nrequest to work from home for a certain number of days a week, and slowly increase that number from there). Doing so can help you get used to the transition from the routine of working at the workplace to the new normal of working from home. More importantly, this can also ease your employer into seeing that any fears that they may have had were unfounded, which would make it easier for you to achieve your target of working from home permanently in the near future.\nDepending on your occupation, one downside from working from home may be that your employer will have less direct oversight over your work performance. If this applies to you, it may be important to keep a record of the metrics that your employer may be interested to know, for example, how many hours you worked, the work/projects that you completed etc. This allows your employers to keep track of your work performance, and also to continually assess whether working from home is suitable. You can also schedule regular check-ins with your supervisor to assure him/her of your work performance.\nSome companies may already have a corporate work from home policy,\ni.e.\na set of company guidelines allowing employees to work from home, and covering matters such as employees’ eligibility for working from home as well as the responsibilities and expectations of both employers and employees while working from home.\nIf your employer has a corporate work from home policy in place, you should definitely go through the policy, as it will give you an insight as to what your employer is really looking out for, and is concerned about when it comes to implementing a work from home policy. This will allow you to equip yourself with the information needed to word your requests to work from home the right way, taking into account these concerns.\nFor a more detailed discussion on\nwhat employers consider when drafting a work from home policy for their employees\n, you can consult our other article on the topic.\n—\nIn conclusion, as working from home becomes the norm, employees and employers alike should bear in mind the latest employment-related legislation that applies to flexible work arrangements, including whether employers are entitled to reduce the remuneration of employees who choose to work from home.\nFor employees who need further tailored advice on flexible work arrangements, or disputes arising from flexible work arrangements, you should\ncontact an experienced employment lawyer\nor\nemployment disputes lawyer\nrespectively. Employment lawyers would be able to review your employment contract and advise you on your rights and obligations, as well as on your legal options in the event of a potential dispute.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)\nWhat is the TADM?\nThe\nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)\nwas jointly set up by the tripartite partners – the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) – to provide advisory and mediation services to resolve salary-related claims and wrongful dismissal claims.\nHow can TADM help me resolve my dispute?\nMediation services\nMediation is a process that seeks to help employees and employers resolve employment-related disputes in an amicable manner. The aim is to reach fair outcomes that both parties to the dispute can agree on, with the assistance of a TADM mediator.\nMediation at the TADM is offered for:\nSalary-related claims covered by:\nYour\nemployment contract\n(E.g. non-payment of bonus or overtime pay); or\nThe Employment Act (EA) (E.g. non-payment of salary); and\nWrongful dismissal claims under the EA and (for maternity-related wrongful dismissal claims) Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA). TADM will first assess a claim on wrongful dismissal to determine if it is suitable for mediation.\nWho can and cannot make a request for mediation?\nYou can only request mediation for a claim if you are an employee who is not a domestic worker, seafarer or public officer. Mediation may also be offered for self-employed persons who are facing other types of employment or payment-related disputes.\nSelf-employed persons should make an appointment for an advisory session at TADM, where the Advisory Officers will go through the details of the case and advise if mediation is suitable.\nAdvisory services\nTADM also offers advisory services for employees and self-employed persons to explore the various options available for managing an employment dispute before they file a claim.\nThis is an optional service for those who may be unsure on what would be the most appropriate option for their dispute. TADM may also recommend other suitable partners who would be better able to assist in the matter.\nFor example, TADM works with the\nLaw Society Pro Bono Services Office\nto provide free basic legal advice, depending on the nature and complexity of the dispute. Other partners include\nFamily Service Centres\nand\nSocial Service Offices\nwhich provide financial assistance, as well as social and emotional support respectively.\nHow can I bring my claim to TADM?\nFor salary-related disputes\nIf the dispute is salary-related, you can submit a request for mediation\nonline\n. You will be required to provide the relevant details of the claim, including the claim amount as well as essential supporting documents. These include:\nYour employment contract or key employment terms;\nSalary payment records and CPF statements (where available);\nLetter of termination or your resignation letter; and\nOther relevant documents to support your claim.\nA mediation session will be scheduled thereafter. Do note that if you are a union member, you should approach your union or NTUC to file your claim on your behalf.\nYou should submit a mediation request to TADM as soon as possible after your claim arises. If your employment has ended, you need to submit your claim within 6 months from the date you left your job. If you are still in employment, however, you need to submit your claim within 1 year from the date of the dispute.\nDo note that registration fees apply. For claims that are S$10,000 or less, the fee payable is S$10, while for claims exceeding S$10,000, the fee payable is S$20.\nYou can only claim up to a maximum of S$20,000, or up to S$30,000 if you go through the Tripartite Mediation Framework or mediation assisted by unions recognised under the Industrial Relations Act.\nIf your claim exceeds the maximum amount, you will need to forego the excess amount so that you can either enter into a\nsettlement agreement\nunder the Employment Claims Act (ECA), or have your case be heard by the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) (see below).\nFor wrongful dismissal claims\nFor\nwrongful dismissal claims\n, the request for mediation can be made online, as is the case for salary-related disputes. You will also be required to provide the relevant details of the claim, including the claim amount as well as the essential supporting documents set out above.\nDo note, however, that TADM will have to first assess if the claim on wrongful dismissal can be substantiated before mediation can be arranged.\nIf your wrongful dismissal claim is non-maternity related, you will need to file your claim within 1 month after your last day of employment. If the claim is maternity-related, you will need to file your claim within 2 months of the birth of your child.\nFor both salary-related and wrongful dismissal claims\nDo note that if you have salary-related and wrongful dismissal claims, you will need to file the two claims separately.\nFor example, if you have been wrongfully dismissed by your employer and your employer owes you your salary, you will have to login to SingPass to file your wrongful dismissal claim, log out, and log back in, to file your salary-related claim.\nFor other employment disputes\nFor non-salary related disputes or other types of employment dispute, you can make an appointment to consult an advisor on your options.\nYou can book an appointment\nonline\nby choosing your preferred date and time. A confirmation of your appointment will be sent to you via e-mail or SMS.\nWhat happens after I’ve filed my claim with TADM?\nOnce you have submitted a request for mediation, a session will be scheduled within 4 weeks. You are required to bring the following documents on the stipulated date and time when your mediation session is scheduled:\nIdentification documents (NRIC, work pass card).\nEmployment contract or key employment terms.\nRelevant documents to support the claim or dispute e.g. salary slips or payment records, termination letter, any email or letter exchanges related to the dispute.\nAlternatively, if you have made an appointment for an advisory session, you are also required to bring along the above documents to help the advisor better understand your claim/dispute.\nYou should be punctual for the mediation as well as advisory sessions.\nThe possible outcomes of the mediation are as follows:\nIf the mediation is successful, a written settlement agreement will be reached. The settlement agreement can be registered as a binding order through the\nCommunity Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS)\nand must be registered within 4 weeks from the date of issue of the settlement agreement. The registration fee is S$10.\nIf the mediation is unsuccessful, the TADM mediator will issue you a Claim Referral Certificate to file a claim at the ECT.\n2.\nEmployment Claims Tribunals (ECT)\nWhat is the ECT?\nThe ECT provides employees and employers with a forum to resolve salary-related and wrongful dismissal disputes that cannot be resolved via mediation at TADM, in a cost-effective and quick manner.\nDo note that claims can only be filed against a respondent (i.e. the other party to the dispute) located in Singapore. The ECT is unable to hear claims filed against parties located outside of Singapore.\nHow can I bring my claim to the ECT?\nYou may file an ECT claim\nonline\nvia the CJTS. You are required to file a claim with the ECT within 4 weeks from the date you were issued the Claim Referral Certificate from the TADM mediator.\nDo note that the ECT can only hear claims that do not exceed S$20,000. However, if your claim exceeds this limit and you still wish to pursue it at ECT, you may abandon the amount in excess of the limit.\nFor more information, refer to our article on\nfiling a claim with the Employment Claims Tribunals\n.\n3. Tripartite Mediation Framework for NTUC Union Members\nWhat is Tripartite Mediation Framework (TMF)?\nTMF was introduced by MOM, with the support of SNEF and NTUC, under the\nIndustrial Relations Act 1960\n. It is a new process for resolving common employment disputes between all unionised Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) or rank-and-file union members and their non-unionised employers.\nTripartite mediation covers the following types of employment disputes:\nNon-payment of salary\nEmployment statutory benefits\nPayment of retrenchment benefits\nBreach of individual employment contract by employer\nRe-employment issues\nWrongful dismissal claims\nHow can tripartite mediation help me resolve my dispute?\nTripartite mediation is facilitated by a mediator from the TADM, who will be assisted by Tripartite Mediation Advisors (TMAs).\nTMAs are industrial relations/human resource practitioners who bring with them a wealth of experience to help address your claim. They are nominated by the tripartite partners and appointed by the Minister for Manpower.\nHow can I bring my claim for tripartite mediation?\nYou are required to submit your query\nonline\nproviding details of the claim or dispute. You will then be contacted by an NTUC case officer who will seek to understand more about your case before advising you on your next steps.\nDo note that NTUC would first seek to resolve the dispute by contacting the management of your organisation to reach an amicable settlement before referring the case for tripartite mediation. The NTUC case officers will assist you with lodging your case for tripartite mediation if an amicable settlement cannot be reached.\nYou are not required to pay any fees for tripartite mediation.\nWhat happens after I’ve brought my claim for tripartite mediation?\nAfter lodging your case for tripartite mediation, your session will be scheduled. During the mediation, the TMAs would provide advice and explore appropriate and available solutions to help you reach an amicable settlement to your dispute.\nHowever, if you are not satisfied with the outcome reached during the tripartite mediation, the following options are available to you:\nFor employment disputes concerning statutory and contractual claims and wrongful dismissal, you may wish to pursue your claim with the ECT.\nFor employment disputes concerning\npayment of retrenchment benefits\nnot provided for in the employment contract, you will need to consider filing a civil suit in court.\n4. Ministry of Manpower (MOM)\nWhat is the MOM?\nThe MOM is responsible for the formulation and implementation of labour policies relating to Singapore’s workforce.\nWhat are the claims/disputes that MOM oversees?\nWork injury compensation\nThe\nWork Injury Compensation Act (WICA)\nallows employees to make claims for work-related injuries or diseases without having to file a suit in the civil courts. It offers a low-cost and efficient alternative to settling compensation claims without the need to engage a lawyer to do so on your behalf.\nClaims can be made up to 1 year from the date of the accident, and you can claim for the following:\nMedical leave wages.\nMedical expenses.\nLump-sum compensation for permanent incapacity or\ndeath\n.\nThe WICA covers any local or foreign employee who is under a contract of service or contract of apprenticeship, regardless of salary, age or nationality. However, it does not cover independent contractors, domestic workers, uniformed personnel and the self-employed.\nEmployment infringements\nMOM also oversees and investigates reports of employment infringement. These include violations of the EA or workplace safety and health violations or lapses that have been committed by an employer so that MOM can take the appropriate action against the employer concerned.\nThis is to help ensure that employers abide by the relevant laws and legislation and abide by good labour practices.\nHow can I bring my claim?\nWork injury compensation\nA claim under the WICA can be lodged using the\nWicSubmit\nonline service. WicSubmit allows you to submit WICA claim-related documents online, receive instant acknowledgement for submitted documents and track your submission status.\nDo note that you should report all work-related accidents and illnesses to your employer first, and seek compensation for medical leave wages or treatment.\nOtherwise, your employer may dispute if the accident or illness is work-related. You should also keep MOM informed by filing an\nincident report\nwho can help you with such disputes.\nFor more information, read our other article on\nhow to obtain work injury compensation\n.\nOther employment-related complaints\nMOM offers a 24-hour online service that allows you to report an employment infringement. As MOM treats each report seriously, you should only lodge a complaint if you are certain that a violation has been committed.\nWhat happens after I bring my claim?\nAfter submitting your claim under WICA, you will be required to undergo a medical assessment. This can be done at any hospital or medical institution, or your employer may request that you be treated or assessed by the company-approved hospital or medical institution.\nOnce MOM receives the medical report, they will calculate the compensation amount, and you will receive a Notice of Assessment (NOA) to inform you, your employer and your employer’s insurer of the compensation amount that is payable to you.\nIf there are no objections from the parties concerned, your employer or your employer’s insurer is required to issue you a compensation cheque within 21 days from the date on which the NOA is received.\nIf any party objects to the compensation amount indicated in the assessment, they are required to complete and submit the objection form that will be attached to the NOA within 14 days from the date on which the NOA is received.\nFurther details on the processes involved for WICA claims is available\nhere\n.\nFor reports of employment infringements, you will be contacted by a MOM officer to verify your report and to advise on the next steps if the alleged infringement is found to be substantiated.\n5. Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)\nWhat is the TAFEP?\nThe TAFEP seeks to promote the adoption of fair, responsible and progressive employment practices among employers, employees and members of the public. It also provides advice and assistance to employees who have encountered\nworkplace discrimination\nand/or harassment.\nDiscriminatory practices can relate to the following grounds:\nAge\nGender\nRace\nReligion\nLanguage\nMarital status and family responsibilities\nDisability\nHow can I bring my claim to TAFEP?\nIf you have experienced workplace discrimination or harassment, you will need to complete an\nonline form\nwith the following details:\nYour name and contact details;\nNRIC number; and\nDetails of the incident of discrimination or harassment.\nTAFEP may contact you for further information about your case depending on the information that you have provided and will follow up with your organisation to pursue the case.\nHowever, if you have any objections or concerns with TAFEP approaching your organisation, you should provide your grounds relating to why TAFEP should not approach your organisation in your report. This will allow TAFEP’s officers to discuss the matter with you when following up on your report, before deciding the next steps forward with your case.\nWhat happens after I’ve filed my claim with TAFEP?\nAfter you have filed your report, a TAFEP officer will speak to you to better understand the incident of discrimination and/or harassment.\nTAFEP will also approach the employer concerned to put in place fair employment practices and ensure there are no further discriminatory practices on the grounds mentioned above.\nTAFEP is also empowered to report discriminatory practices that do not adhere to the\nTripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices\nto MOM for further investigations. Appropriate actions will be taken against the offending organisation if such lapses are found.\n6. Civil Courts\nBringing your dispute to court\nwould be the avenue of last resort, as the mechanisms highlighted above are intended to ensure that employment disputes can be addressed in a cost-effective and amicable manner as far as possible.\nHowever, there may be instances where you may wish to file a civil suit in relation to your claim or dispute.\nWork injury compensation\nEmployees injured at work can either claim under WICA or file a civil suit within 1 year from the date of the accident. If you have filed a claim under WICA and wish to withdraw it to pursue a civil claim, you can do so at any time before MOM issues your NOA.\nIf you decide to withdraw your claim under WICA and file a civil suit against your employer instead, you will need to do so within the following timeframes:\nWithin 14 days from the date of service of the NOA, if there are no objections;\nWithin 28 days from the date of service of the NOA, if any party objects to the compensation amount; or\nAt any time before the NOA is issued.\nDo note that the court may not accept your civil suit if you do not withdraw your claim under WICA within these timeframes.\nWorkplace harassment\nAs harassment within or outside the workplace may amount to an offence under the Protection of Harassment Act (POHA), you may wish to apply for a\nProtection Order\n, Expedited Protection Order or Non-Publication Order from the State Courts to protect you from such harassing behaviour.\nYou can also sue your harasser for monetary compensation by filing a suit through the District Court.\nFor serious cases of harassment, and if you believe that the harasser has committed a criminal offence, you should make a police report or\nfile a Magistrate’s Complaint\n.\nIn these cases, if you decide to pursue a civil claim or seek criminal sanctions, you should seek legal advice from a lawyer who would be better able to advise you on the procedures involved.\n—\nFinally, it is important to remember that you should try to prepare as much evidence as you can for their case when seeking recourse through the various avenues outlined above.\nWhile these avenues are available to help an employee resolve an employment-related dispute or claim, you should always try to resolve the matter with your employer and reach an amicable settlement as far as possible first.\nIf you require a legal review of your employment situation, you can\nbook a phone consultation with an experienced employment dispute lawyer\n.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)\nWhat is the TADM?\nThe\nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)\nwas jointly set up by the tripartite partners – the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) – to provide advisory and mediation services to resolve salary-related claims and wrongful dismissal claims.\nHow can TADM help me resolve my dispute?\nMediation services\nMediation is a process that seeks to help employees and employers resolve employment-related disputes in an amicable manner. The aim is to reach fair outcomes that both parties to the dispute can agree on, with the assistance of a TADM mediator.\nMediation at the TADM is offered for:\nSalary-related claims covered by:\nYour\nemployment contract\n(E.g. non-payment of bonus or overtime pay); or\nThe Employment Act (EA) (E.g. non-payment of salary); and\nWrongful dismissal claims under the EA and (for maternity-related wrongful dismissal claims) Child Development Co-Savings Act (CDCA). TADM will first assess a claim on wrongful dismissal to determine if it is suitable for mediation.\nWho can and cannot make a request for mediation?\nYou can only request mediation for a claim if you are an employee who is not a domestic worker, seafarer or public officer. Mediation may also be offered for self-employed persons who are facing other types of employment or payment-related disputes.\nSelf-employed persons should make an appointment for an advisory session at TADM, where the Advisory Officers will go through the details of the case and advise if mediation is suitable.\nAdvisory services\nTADM also offers advisory services for employees and self-employed persons to explore the various options available for managing an employment dispute before they file a claim.\nThis is an optional service for those who may be unsure on what would be the most appropriate option for their dispute. TADM may also recommend other suitable partners who would be better able to assist in the matter.\nFor example, TADM works with the\nLaw Society Pro Bono Services Office\nto provide free basic legal advice, depending on the nature and complexity of the dispute. Other partners include\nFamily Service Centres\nand\nSocial Service Offices\nwhich provide financial assistance, as well as social and emotional support respectively.\nHow can I bring my claim to TADM?\nFor salary-related disputes\nIf the dispute is salary-related, you can submit a request for mediation\nonline\n. You will be required to provide the relevant details of the claim, including the claim amount as well as essential supporting documents. These include:\nYour employment contract or key employment terms;\nSalary payment records and CPF statements (where available);\nLetter of termination or your resignation letter; and\nOther relevant documents to support your claim.\nA mediation session will be scheduled thereafter. Do note that if you are a union member, you should approach your union or NTUC to file your claim on your behalf.\nYou should submit a mediation request to TADM as soon as possible after your claim arises. If your employment has ended, you need to submit your claim within 6 months from the date you left your job. If you are still in employment, however, you need to submit your claim within 1 year from the date of the dispute.\nDo note that registration fees apply. For claims that are S$10,000 or less, the fee payable is S$10, while for claims exceeding S$10,000, the fee payable is S$20.\nYou can only claim up to a maximum of S$20,000, or up to S$30,000 if you go through the Tripartite Mediation Framework or mediation assisted by unions recognised under the Industrial Relations Act.\nIf your claim exceeds the maximum amount, you will need to forego the excess amount so that you can either enter into a\nsettlement agreement\nunder the Employment Claims Act (ECA), or have your case be heard by the Employment Claims Tribunal (ECT) (see below).\nFor wrongful dismissal claims\nFor\nwrongful dismissal claims\n, the request for mediation can be made online, as is the case for salary-related disputes. You will also be required to provide the relevant details of the claim, including the claim amount as well as the essential supporting documents set out above.\nDo note, however, that TADM will have to first assess if the claim on wrongful dismissal can be substantiated before mediation can be arranged.\nIf your wrongful dismissal claim is non-maternity related, you will need to file your claim within 1 month after your last day of employment. If the claim is maternity-related, you will need to file your claim within 2 months of the birth of your child.\nFor both salary-related and wrongful dismissal claims\nDo note that if you have salary-related and wrongful dismissal claims, you will need to file the two claims separately.\nFor example, if you have been wrongfully dismissed by your employer and your employer owes you your salary, you will have to login to SingPass to file your wrongful dismissal claim, log out, and log back in, to file your salary-related claim.\nFor other employment disputes\nFor non-salary related disputes or other types of employment dispute, you can make an appointment to consult an advisor on your options.\nYou can book an appointment\nonline\nby choosing your preferred date and time. A confirmation of your appointment will be sent to you via e-mail or SMS.\nWhat happens after I’ve filed my claim with TADM?\nOnce you have submitted a request for mediation, a session will be scheduled within 4 weeks. You are required to bring the following documents on the stipulated date and time when your mediation session is scheduled:\nIdentification documents (NRIC, work pass card).\nEmployment contract or key employment terms.\nRelevant documents to support the claim or dispute e.g. salary slips or payment records, termination letter, any email or letter exchanges related to the dispute.\nAlternatively, if you have made an appointment for an advisory session, you are also required to bring along the above documents to help the advisor better understand your claim/dispute.\nYou should be punctual for the mediation as well as advisory sessions.\nThe possible outcomes of the mediation are as follows:\nIf the mediation is successful, a written settlement agreement will be reached. The settlement agreement can be registered as a binding order through the\nCommunity Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS)\nand must be registered within 4 weeks from the date of issue of the settlement agreement. The registration fee is S$10.\nIf the mediation is unsuccessful, the TADM mediator will issue you a Claim Referral Certificate to file a claim at the ECT.\n2.\nEmployment Claims Tribunals (ECT)\nWhat is the ECT?\nThe ECT provides employees and employers with a forum to resolve salary-related and wrongful dismissal disputes that cannot be resolved via mediation at TADM, in a cost-effective and quick manner.\nDo note that claims can only be filed against a respondent (i.e. the other party to the dispute) located in Singapore. The ECT is unable to hear claims filed against parties located outside of Singapore.\nHow can I bring my claim to the ECT?\nYou may file an ECT claim\nonline\nvia the CJTS. You are required to file a claim with the ECT within 4 weeks from the date you were issued the Claim Referral Certificate from the TADM mediator.\nDo note that the ECT can only hear claims that do not exceed S$20,000. However, if your claim exceeds this limit and you still wish to pursue it at ECT, you may abandon the amount in excess of the limit.\nFor more information, refer to our article on\nfiling a claim with the Employment Claims Tribunals\n.\n3. Tripartite Mediation Framework for NTUC Union Members\nWhat is Tripartite Mediation Framework (TMF)?\nTMF was introduced by MOM, with the support of SNEF and NTUC, under the\nIndustrial Relations Act 1960\n. It is a new process for resolving common employment disputes between all unionised Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) or rank-and-file union members and their non-unionised employers.\nTripartite mediation covers the following types of employment disputes:\nNon-payment of salary\nEmployment statutory benefits\nPayment of retrenchment benefits\nBreach of individual employment contract by employer\nRe-employment issues\nWrongful dismissal claims\nHow can tripartite mediation help me resolve my dispute?\nTripartite mediation is facilitated by a mediator from the TADM, who will be assisted by Tripartite Mediation Advisors (TMAs).\nTMAs are industrial relations/human resource practitioners who bring with them a wealth of experience to help address your claim. They are nominated by the tripartite partners and appointed by the Minister for Manpower.\nHow can I bring my claim for tripartite mediation?\nYou are required to submit your query\nonline\nproviding details of the claim or dispute. You will then be contacted by an NTUC case officer who will seek to understand more about your case before advising you on your next steps.\nDo note that NTUC would first seek to resolve the dispute by contacting the management of your organisation to reach an amicable settlement before referring the case for tripartite mediation. The NTUC case officers will assist you with lodging your case for tripartite mediation if an amicable settlement cannot be reached.\nYou are not required to pay any fees for tripartite mediation.\nWhat happens after I’ve brought my claim for tripartite mediation?\nAfter lodging your case for tripartite mediation, your session will be scheduled. During the mediation, the TMAs would provide advice and explore appropriate and available solutions to help you reach an amicable settlement to your dispute.\nHowever, if you are not satisfied with the outcome reached during the tripartite mediation, the following options are available to you:\nFor employment disputes concerning statutory and contractual claims and wrongful dismissal, you may wish to pursue your claim with the ECT.\nFor employment disputes concerning\npayment of retrenchment benefits\nnot provided for in the employment contract, you will need to consider filing a civil suit in court.\n4. Ministry of Manpower (MOM)\nWhat is the MOM?\nThe MOM is responsible for the formulation and implementation of labour policies relating to Singapore’s workforce.\nWhat are the claims/disputes that MOM oversees?\nWork injury compensation\nThe\nWork Injury Compensation Act (WICA)\nallows employees to make claims for work-related injuries or diseases without having to file a suit in the civil courts. It offers a low-cost and efficient alternative to settling compensation claims without the need to engage a lawyer to do so on your behalf.\nClaims can be made up to 1 year from the date of the accident, and you can claim for the following:\nMedical leave wages.\nMedical expenses.\nLump-sum compensation for permanent incapacity or\ndeath\n.\nThe WICA covers any local or foreign employee who is under a contract of service or contract of apprenticeship, regardless of salary, age or nationality. However, it does not cover independent contractors, domestic workers, uniformed personnel and the self-employed.\nEmployment infringements\nMOM also oversees and investigates reports of employment infringement. These include violations of the EA or workplace safety and health violations or lapses that have been committed by an employer so that MOM can take the appropriate action against the employer concerned.\nThis is to help ensure that employers abide by the relevant laws and legislation and abide by good labour practices.\nHow can I bring my claim?\nWork injury compensation\nA claim under the WICA can be lodged using the\nWicSubmit\nonline service. WicSubmit allows you to submit WICA claim-related documents online, receive instant acknowledgement for submitted documents and track your submission status.\nDo note that you should report all work-related accidents and illnesses to your employer first, and seek compensation for medical leave wages or treatment.\nOtherwise, your employer may dispute if the accident or illness is work-related. You should also keep MOM informed by filing an\nincident report\nwho can help you with such disputes.\nFor more information, read our other article on\nhow to obtain work injury compensation\n.\nOther employment-related complaints\nMOM offers a 24-hour online service that allows you to report an employment infringement. As MOM treats each report seriously, you should only lodge a complaint if you are certain that a violation has been committed.\nWhat happens after I bring my claim?\nAfter submitting your claim under WICA, you will be required to undergo a medical assessment. This can be done at any hospital or medical institution, or your employer may request that you be treated or assessed by the company-approved hospital or medical institution.\nOnce MOM receives the medical report, they will calculate the compensation amount, and you will receive a Notice of Assessment (NOA) to inform you, your employer and your employer’s insurer of the compensation amount that is payable to you.\nIf there are no objections from the parties concerned, your employer or your employer’s insurer is required to issue you a compensation cheque within 21 days from the date on which the NOA is received.\nIf any party objects to the compensation amount indicated in the assessment, they are required to complete and submit the objection form that will be attached to the NOA within 14 days from the date on which the NOA is received.\nFurther details on the processes involved for WICA claims is available\nhere\n.\nFor reports of employment infringements, you will be contacted by a MOM officer to verify your report and to advise on the next steps if the alleged infringement is found to be substantiated.\n5. Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)\nWhat is the TAFEP?\nThe TAFEP seeks to promote the adoption of fair, responsible and progressive employment practices among employers, employees and members of the public. It also provides advice and assistance to employees who have encountered\nworkplace discrimination\nand/or harassment.\nDiscriminatory practices can relate to the following grounds:\nAge\nGender\nRace\nReligion\nLanguage\nMarital status and family responsibilities\nDisability\nHow can I bring my claim to TAFEP?\nIf you have experienced workplace discrimination or harassment, you will need to complete an\nonline form\nwith the following details:\nYour name and contact details;\nNRIC number; and\nDetails of the incident of discrimination or harassment.\nTAFEP may contact you for further information about your case depending on the information that you have provided and will follow up with your organisation to pursue the case.\nHowever, if you have any objections or concerns with TAFEP approaching your organisation, you should provide your grounds relating to why TAFEP should not approach your organisation in your report. This will allow TAFEP’s officers to discuss the matter with you when following up on your report, before deciding the next steps forward with your case.\nWhat happens after I’ve filed my claim with TAFEP?\nAfter you have filed your report, a TAFEP officer will speak to you to better understand the incident of discrimination and/or harassment.\nTAFEP will also approach the employer concerned to put in place fair employment practices and ensure there are no further discriminatory practices on the grounds mentioned above.\nTAFEP is also empowered to report discriminatory practices that do not adhere to the\nTripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices\nto MOM for further investigations. Appropriate actions will be taken against the offending organisation if such lapses are found.\n6. Civil Courts\nBringing your dispute to court\nwould be the avenue of last resort, as the mechanisms highlighted above are intended to ensure that employment disputes can be addressed in a cost-effective and amicable manner as far as possible.\nHowever, there may be instances where you may wish to file a civil suit in relation to your claim or dispute.\nWork injury compensation\nEmployees injured at work can either claim under WICA or file a civil suit within 1 year from the date of the accident. If you have filed a claim under WICA and wish to withdraw it to pursue a civil claim, you can do so at any time before MOM issues your NOA.\nIf you decide to withdraw your claim under WICA and file a civil suit against your employer instead, you will need to do so within the following timeframes:\nWithin 14 days from the date of service of the NOA, if there are no objections;\nWithin 28 days from the date of service of the NOA, if any party objects to the compensation amount; or\nAt any time before the NOA is issued.\nDo note that the court may not accept your civil suit if you do not withdraw your claim under WICA within these timeframes.\nWorkplace harassment\nAs harassment within or outside the workplace may amount to an offence under the Protection of Harassment Act (POHA), you may wish to apply for a\nProtection Order\n, Expedited Protection Order or Non-Publication Order from the State Courts to protect you from such harassing behaviour.\nYou can also sue your harasser for monetary compensation by filing a suit through the District Court.\nFor serious cases of harassment, and if you believe that the harasser has committed a criminal offence, you should make a police report or\nfile a Magistrate’s Complaint\n.\nIn these cases, if you decide to pursue a civil claim or seek criminal sanctions, you should seek legal advice from a lawyer who would be better able to advise you on the procedures involved.\n—\nFinally, it is important to remember that you should try to prepare as much evidence as you can for their case when seeking recourse through the various avenues outlined above.\nWhile these avenues are available to help an employee resolve an employment-related dispute or claim, you should always try to resolve the matter with your employer and reach an amicable settlement as far as possible first.\nIf you require a legal review of your employment situation, you can\nbook a phone consultation with an experienced employment dispute lawyer\n.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Both employers and employees engage employment lawyers to assist them with employment-related legal matters,\nwhich are primarily governed by the\nEmployment Act\n(EA).\nThis article will cover what an employment lawyer can do for you and how to find a suitable employment lawyer for your legal needs. It will discuss:\nWhy Might You Need An Employment Lawyer?\nIf you are an employer\nIf you are an employer, an employment lawyer can help you navigate the various regulations governing hiring practices in Singapore. Examples of such regulations include being required to make Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions for your employees as per the CPF Act\nand having to issue itemised pay slips to employees covered by the Employment Act.

An employment lawyer can help you draft the employment contract in order to ensure legal precision and comprehensiveness, as well as include in the contract any special employment clauses which are usually specified by the employer. Employment lawyers can also draft other documents such as employee handbooks which set out your company policies, along with employees’ rights and obligations.\nGuidance on hiring foreign workers\n: Hiring foreign workers can be a complex process, with differing application procedures and passes required for different skill levels of workers, as well as requirements for levies and quotas of workers in different industries.

An employment lawyer can help determine the amount of compensation you are entitled to and advise you on the most cost-efficient way to recover your unpaid salary.\nApart from employment lawyers, are there other avenues of assistance for employment disputes?\nIn certain situations, especially if you are an employee, it might be advisable to seek initial advice from other agencies such as the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) and the Tripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) before seeking independent legal advice on your issue. Here is a brief overview of the services provided by such agencies and the types of situations they cover:\nMOM\n:\nMOM oversees work injury compensation cases by allowing employees to claim for work-related injuries or diseases without having to engage a lawyer to file a suit in the civil courts. MOM also deals with cases of employment infringement, such as violations of the EA or violations of workplace health and safety regulations.\nTADM\n: The TADM provides advisory and mediation services targeted at resolving claims related to salaries and wrongful dismissals. If your dispute cannot be resolved via mediation at the TADM, you may then seek recourse from the  Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT).\nTAFEP\n: TAFEP provides advice and assistance to employees facing workplace discrimination or harassment. Hence, if you feel that you are being unfairly discriminated against or harassed in the workplace, you may seek recourse from TAFEP.\nFor more information, you may refer to our other article on\nhow employees can seek help for employment disputes\nwithout having to engage an employment lawyer.\nHowever, if these avenues of redress do not work, produce an unsatisfactory result or there is simply no amicable means of resolving the dispute at hand such as through mediation, you may need to engage an employment lawyer to assist you. This is especially so if the case is particularly severe or complex. A complex case might involve multiple claims and parties—for instance, it could include both workplace abuse and discrimination, with abuse being inflicted by more than one party. Severe cases could include persistent abuse over a long period of time, with the abuser exhibiting especially egregious behaviour such as using extreme threats, highly abusive language or even engaging in physical violence.\nIt might be helpful to do some research beforehand on the specific legal service that you require; this can help you narrow down your search for lawyers who are experienced in that particular area or employment matter. To learn more about employment law and specific matters within this area (for both employers and employees), do refer to our list of\nresources on employment law\n.\nFinding Employment Lawyers in Singapore\nBefore embarking on your search for an employment lawyer, it is important to understand the different types of employment lawyers that are practising in Singapore.

For instance, some lawyers specialise in work injury compensation cases, while others may have more expertise in wrongful termination cases. Additionally, the lawyer you engage could also depend on whether you are an employer or employee; some lawyers have more experience assisting employees while others focus on employer-specific matters such as advising on hiring practices.\nComplexity of your case\nWhen deciding whether to engage an employment lawyer from a small or large firm, you would need to consider the level of complexity of your case. For more complex cases involving a large number of employees spanning across countries (e.g. employees who are contracted to the parent company in one country and the subsidiary in another country), a larger law firm would likely be more suitable since they tend to be equipped with more resources to handle your case. On the other hand, if you are dealing with more straightforward cases of a smaller scale, such as drafting employment contracts or hiring foreign workers, a small firm or solo practitioner would likely be sufficient.\nShortlisting an employment lawyer\nThere are various ways to shortlist an employment lawyer. Reviews and referrals from trusted peers who have previously engaged an employment lawyer could be a good way to narrow down your search as this method allows you to get a good sense of the lawyer’s capability and rapport with clients.

This is important as it helps you get a deeper understanding of the lawyer/firm that you are working with, which may not be attained by simply looking up the firm’s website or reviews.\nHere are some examples of questions to ask during the consultation:\nWhat kind of legal services does the lawyer/firm provide?\nWhat is the cost of the legal services required for your matter? What is the fee structure like?\nWhat is the set-up of the firm, and who will you be dealing with? Even though you will be dealing with an employment lawyer, it is helpful to know his/her position in the law firm e.g. junior associate, senior associate or partner. This information can give you some insight into his/her years of experience in the legal profession, as well as his/her level of expertise in dealing with your case. To understand more about the hierarchy of lawyers within law firms, you may refer to our article on the\ntypes of lawyers in Singapore\n.\nWhat is the mode of communication between you and the lawyer, and how frequently will he/she be available?\nWhat is the lawyer’s area of specialisation within employment law?\nDoes the lawyer/firm have experience handling similar cases pertaining to your issue? What was the outcome/result of those cases?\nThese questions will help you obtain crucial information so that you can make the final decision on which lawyer/firm best suits your legal needs for your employment-related matters.\n—\nRegardless of whether you are an employer or employee, employment disputes can be highly stressful and time-consuming; hence, it is important to select a suitable employment lawyer based on your legal needs to help smoothen the process.

While about 86 per cent of the cases were salary-related claims, most of the rest were claims for wrongful dismissals.\nIf you are an employee who is covered under the\nEmployment Act\nand feel that you have been wrongfully dismissed, this article covers the various options and avenues for legal recourse that you might have in such a situation.\nWhat is a Dismissal?\nDismissal means that an employer has terminated an employee’s contract of service. It may be with or without notice, and on grounds of misconduct or not.\nIt also includes situations where an employee resigns involuntarily.\nFor termination with notice, a dated, written notice of termination can be given by your employer from 1 day to 4 weeks in advance based on the duration of your employment (if you and your employer have not previously agreed on a notice period). For example, if you have been employed for 26 weeks or less, your employer should give you at least 1 day’s notice.\nTermination may also occur either without any advance notice or during the notice period where your employer would you salary in lieu of serving the notice of the period.\nIs Your Dismissal Valid?\nYour dismissal is considered valid if it is made on the following grounds:\nMisconduct\n, for example, due to disorderly conduct at work;\nPoor performance\n, shown in the inability to meet required standards of work; and\nRedundancy\n, i.e. the employee’s job scope has changed and the old job scope no longer exists.\nMisconduct is the only ground for dismissal that does not require notice\n. However, a\ndue inquiry\nmust be conducted by your employer, on the alleged act of misconduct, prior to making a decision on dismissing you.\nSimilarly, in the case of dismissal for reasons of poor performance, the employer must substantiate the reason (e.g. provide documented proof of the employee’s poor performance), failing which, the dismissal would be considered wrongful (more below).\nWhen is Your Dismissal Considered Wrongful?\nWrongful dismissal occurs when an employee is dismissed without just or sufficient cause.\nThe\nTripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal\nprovides some examples, which include:\nWrongful dismissals include:\nDismissal on\ndiscriminatory grounds\nbased on age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities or disability.\nDismissal to\ndeprive an employee of benefits or entitlements\n, e.g. to deprive an employee of her maternity benefits.\nDismissal to\npunish an employee for exercising an employment right\n, e.g. dismissing employee after the employee submitted a mediation request over a salary-related dispute.\nWhile the Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal are not legally-binding, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has\nstated\nthat it can take action against organisations that fail to comply with these guidelines.\nWhat You Can Do If You Think You have been\nWrongfully Dismissed\nIf you believe that you have been wrongfully dismissed and wish to file a claim, there are several things that you will need to take note of beforehand.\nHave a meeting with your HR department\nAs a first step, as soon as you are informed that you have been dismissed, you should arrange for a meeting with your organisation’s HR representatives to better understand their grounds for dismissal.\nYou should this meeting as an opportunity to seek clarification for your dismissal. Be open to having a transparent and honest discussion with your HR representatives.\nThere may be a possibility that your employment in the company could be reinstated if the dismissal arose out of a misunderstanding or miscommunication.\nHowever, if your employer insists on the dismissal, you can then consider pursuing a claim.\nFiling a claim for wrongful dismissal\nNote that you must file a wrongful dismissal claim at TADM\nwithin one month\nfrom the last day of your employment, if you feel that your dismissal was wrongful.\nFor dismissals\nwithout notice\n, your employer must show proof that the dismissal was not wrongful. For example, suppose you are employed a warehouse assistant. You have been involved in multiple incidents that resulted in poor quality services provided by the warehouse. Your supervisor has documented these shortcomings in the performance reviews and provided additional resources and support to help improve your performance. Despite this, your performance did not improve and you are dismissed without notice because of your poor work performance. Your employer in this instance has documented proof of your poor performance.\nFor dismissals\nwith notice or salary in lieu of notice\n, you must show proof that your dismissal was wrongful. Take the case of an employee who is dismissed and no reason is given for the dismissal. However, the employee had reported that his employer had made a number of discriminatory remarks about the employee’s race,  with the employer even stating that he preferred to hire someone of another race. Even though the employer had dismissed the employee with notice, the employer’s conduct would support the employee’s claim that he was wrongfully dismissed because of racial discrimination.\nFile a claim with the\nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)\nTADM is jointly set up by the tripartite partners – MOM, theNational Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF). They provide employees with mediation, advisory services, support services and free basic legal advice to help resolve employment-related issues.\nAll employees, except for a domestic worker, seafarer or public officer, can file a claim for mediation with the TADM. However, the following persons must have first served their employers for the minimum duration of at least:\nFor\nmanagers and executives\n: If you were dismissed with notice or salary in lieu of notice, you can only file a wrongful dismissal claim if you have served your employer for\nat least 6 months\n.\nIf you were\ndismissed while pregnant\n:\n3 months\n.\nIf you are a manager or executive and have been dismissed without notice, no minimum duration of employment is required.\nAdditionally, for all employees whose employer still owes you your salary, your salary-related claim must be filed in addition to the unfair dismissal claim (i.e. 2 separate claims must be filed).\nThe following are options to file your claims, depending on whether you are a non-union member, a union member or an NTUC member:\nOption 1\n: If you are a non-union member, file\na claim for mediation with TADM\n.\nYou must file your claim either within:\n1 month after your last day of employment; or\n2 months of child birth if you were wrongfully dismissed during pregnancy.\nTo file your claim, you can either fill in TADM’s\ne-claim form\nusing SingPass or\nmake an appointment\nif you do not have a SingPass, along with the following supporting documents:\nEmployment contract;\nSalary payment records and CPF statements;\nTermination or resignation letter; and\nAny other written documents to support your claim.\nThe registration fees for filing a claim are as follows:\nClaim Amount\nRegistration Fee\nUp to $10,000\n$10\nMore than $10,000\n$20\nPayment can be made with your credit or debit card, or via internet banking.\nOption 2\n: If you are a union member, you may approach your union to assist in filing your claim for mediation.

While about 86 per cent of the cases were salary-related claims, most of the rest were claims for wrongful dismissals.\nIf you are an employee who is covered under the\nEmployment Act\nand feel that you have been wrongfully dismissed, this article covers the various options and avenues for legal recourse that you might have in such a situation.\nWhat is a Dismissal?\nDismissal means that an employer has terminated an employee’s contract of service. It may be with or without notice, and on grounds of misconduct or not.\nIt also includes situations where an employee resigns involuntarily.\nFor termination with notice, a dated, written notice of termination can be given by your employer from 1 day to 4 weeks in advance based on the duration of your employment (if you and your employer have not previously agreed on a notice period). For example, if you have been employed for 26 weeks or less, your employer should give you at least 1 day’s notice.\nTermination may also occur either without any advance notice or during the notice period where your employer would you salary in lieu of serving the notice of the period.\nIs Your Dismissal Valid?\nYour dismissal is considered valid if it is made on the following grounds:\nMisconduct\n, for example, due to disorderly conduct at work;\nPoor performance\n, shown in the inability to meet required standards of work; and\nRedundancy\n, i.e. the employee’s job scope has changed and the old job scope no longer exists.\nMisconduct is the only ground for dismissal that does not require notice\n. However, a\ndue inquiry\nmust be conducted by your employer, on the alleged act of misconduct, prior to making a decision on dismissing you.\nSimilarly, in the case of dismissal for reasons of poor performance, the employer must substantiate the reason (e.g. provide documented proof of the employee’s poor performance), failing which, the dismissal would be considered wrongful (more below).\nWhen is Your Dismissal Considered Wrongful?\nWrongful dismissal occurs when an employee is dismissed without just or sufficient cause.\nThe\nTripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal\nprovides some examples, which include:\nWrongful dismissals include:\nDismissal on\ndiscriminatory grounds\nbased on age, race, gender, religion, marital status and family responsibilities or disability.\nDismissal to\ndeprive an employee of benefits or entitlements\n, e.g. to deprive an employee of her maternity benefits.\nDismissal to\npunish an employee for exercising an employment right\n, e.g. dismissing employee after the employee submitted a mediation request over a salary-related dispute.\nWhile the Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal are not legally-binding, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has\nstated\nthat it can take action against organisations that fail to comply with these guidelines.\nWhat You Can Do If You Think You have been\nWrongfully Dismissed\nIf you believe that you have been wrongfully dismissed and wish to file a claim, there are several things that you will need to take note of beforehand.\nHave a meeting with your HR department\nAs a first step, as soon as you are informed that you have been dismissed, you should arrange for a meeting with your organisation’s HR representatives to better understand their grounds for dismissal.\nYou should this meeting as an opportunity to seek clarification for your dismissal. Be open to having a transparent and honest discussion with your HR representatives.\nThere may be a possibility that your employment in the company could be reinstated if the dismissal arose out of a misunderstanding or miscommunication.\nHowever, if your employer insists on the dismissal, you can then consider pursuing a claim.\nFiling a claim for wrongful dismissal\nNote that you must file a wrongful dismissal claim at TADM\nwithin one month\nfrom the last day of your employment, if you feel that your dismissal was wrongful.\nFor dismissals\nwithout notice\n, your employer must show proof that the dismissal was not wrongful. For example, suppose you are employed a warehouse assistant. You have been involved in multiple incidents that resulted in poor quality services provided by the warehouse. Your supervisor has documented these shortcomings in the performance reviews and provided additional resources and support to help improve your performance. Despite this, your performance did not improve and you are dismissed without notice because of your poor work performance. Your employer in this instance has documented proof of your poor performance.\nFor dismissals\nwith notice or salary in lieu of notice\n, you must show proof that your dismissal was wrongful. Take the case of an employee who is dismissed and no reason is given for the dismissal. However, the employee had reported that his employer had made a number of discriminatory remarks about the employee’s race,  with the employer even stating that he preferred to hire someone of another race. Even though the employer had dismissed the employee with notice, the employer’s conduct would support the employee’s claim that he was wrongfully dismissed because of racial discrimination.\nFile a claim with the\nTripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)\nTADM is jointly set up by the tripartite partners – MOM, theNational Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF). They provide employees with mediation, advisory services, support services and free basic legal advice to help resolve employment-related issues.\nAll employees, except for a domestic worker, seafarer or public officer, can file a claim for mediation with the TADM. However, the following persons must have first served their employers for the minimum duration of at least:\nFor\nmanagers and executives\n: If you were dismissed with notice or salary in lieu of notice, you can only file a wrongful dismissal claim if you have served your employer for\nat least 6 months\n.\nIf you were\ndismissed while pregnant\n:\n3 months\n.\nIf you are a manager or executive and have been dismissed without notice, no minimum duration of employment is required.\nAdditionally, for all employees whose employer still owes you your salary, your salary-related claim must be filed in addition to the unfair dismissal claim (i.e. 2 separate claims must be filed).\nThe following are options to file your claims, depending on whether you are a non-union member, a union member or an NTUC member:\nOption 1\n: If you are a non-union member, file\na claim for mediation with TADM\n.\nYou must file your claim either within:\n1 month after your last day of employment; or\n2 months of child birth if you were wrongfully dismissed during pregnancy.\nTo file your claim, you can either fill in TADM’s\ne-claim form\nusing SingPass or\nmake an appointment\nif you do not have a SingPass, along with the following supporting documents:\nEmployment contract;\nSalary payment records and CPF statements;\nTermination or resignation letter; and\nAny other written documents to support your claim.\nThe registration fees for filing a claim are as follows:\nClaim Amount\nRegistration Fee\nUp to $10,000\n$10\nMore than $10,000\n$20\nPayment can be made with your credit or debit card, or via internet banking.\nOption 2\n: If you are a union member, you may approach your union to assist in filing your claim for mediation. To do so, ensure that you have:\nLeft your company within 1 month of the last day of employment.\n(For NTUC members) Been a member of NTUC for at least 6 months.\nThe same documents and registration fee as mentioned in\nOption 1\napply.\nNTUC members employed in non-unionised companies and are members of a registered trade union (without representation rights), can also choose to engage in Tripartite Mediation (TM) by submitting an\nonline query\nto NTUC.\nWhat happens after I’ve filed a mediation claim with the TADM?\nAfter filing a mediation claim, TADM will first assess if your wrongful dismissal claim can be substantiated prior to arranging a mediation session.

{"chunk_id": "SLA_f4e783b2", "source_type": "guideline", "title": "All You Need to Know About the Employment Claims Tribunals", "category": "Learning Centre > Employment Law > Employment Disputes > All You Need to Know About the Employment Claims Tribunals", "text": "All You Need to Know About the Employment Claims Tribunals\nLast updated on September 9, 2025\nThe Employment Claims Tribunals (ECT) hear salary-related and wrongful dismissal disputes between employers and employees. In contrast, the Small Claims Tribunals primarily hear disputes between consumers and suppliers, and do not handle salary-related or wrongful dismissal claims, which fall within the jurisdiction of the ECT. If you intend to pursue a claim for non-payment of salary, wrongful dismissal, or other matters within the jurisdiction of the ECT as outlined below, this article explains the types of claims you may file, the filing process, and the implications for businesses and Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs).\nThis article explores:\nThe jurisdiction of the ECT;\nTypes of claims that can be brought to the ECT;\nTypes of claims that cannot be brought to the ECT;\nPowers of the ECT;\nImplications for businesses; and\nImplications for Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs).\nJurisdiction of the ECT\nThe ECT is established under the Employment Claims Act 2016 (ECA). According to the ECA, the ECT is empowered to hear all claims listed in the Second Schedule of the ECA pertaining to the Employment Act, the\nRetirement and Re-employment Act\n, and the Child Development Co-Savings Act.\nMaximum Limit of the Claim\nThe maximum limit of the claim cannot exceed $20,000 at the ECT. However, the maximum amount is increased to $30,000 if the employee attends the mediation session conducted by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), or if the dispute has undergone mediation assisted by the trade unions.\nIf your claim exceeds the maximum limit stated above and if you still wish for your case to be heard at the ECT, you must abandon the excess amount. For example, if your claim is $50,000 and the maximum applicable limit is $30,000, you must agree to abandon the excess amount of $20,000 for the ECT to hear your claims. The abandoned excess amount is not claimable in any tribunal or court.\nIf you do not wish to abandon the excess amount, you may wish to consider seeking legal advice from our employment lawyers to pursue your claim in the civil courts.\nTypes of Claims that Can be Brought to the ECT\nSalary-related claims\nThe ECT can hear both statutory and contractual salary-related claims. Statutory salary-related claims are claims such as unpaid salaries, overtime pay and\nmaternity benefits\n. These claims are backed by statutes, e.g. Employment Act, Retirement and Re-employment Act, or the Child Development Co-Savings Act.\nFor statutory salary-related claims, the ECT often hears claims such as:\nNon-payment or partial payment of salary\nNon-payment or partial payment for overtime work requested by an employer\nNon-payment or partial payment of salary for work on rest days\nUnauthorised salary deductions\nPublic holiday pay\nEntitlement to paid annual leave\nSalary in lieu of notice\nSick leave pay\nNon-payment of maternity benefit under Part III of the Child Development Co-Savings Act\nEmployment assistance payment under Part IV of the Retirement and Re-employment Act\nFor contractual salary-related claims, the ECT can hear the following types of claims:\nAllowance\nAnnual wage supplement\nBonus payment\nCommission\nDeduction from salary\nEmployment assistance payment\nIncentive payment\nMedical benefit\nOvertime payment\nPay for extra work\nPay for public holiday or paid leave\nPay for work on public holiday\nPay for work on rest day\nPayment in lieu of unconsumed leave\nReimbursement\nfor expenses incurred while carrying out official duties\nSalary\nSalary in lieu of notice of termination\nTermination benefit (including\nretrenchment benefit\nor retirement benefit)\nDo note that claims need to be mediated at TADM before they can be heard at the ECT.\nWrongful dismissal claims\nIf you are an employee dismissed without just cause or excuse, you may make a wrongful dismissal claim. The ECT also hears such claims from 1 April 2019 onwards. Previously, employees had to bring such claims to the Ministry of Manpower. More information on wrongful dismissal of claims may be found in the\ntripartite guidelines on wrongful dismissal\n.\nEmployees who have been wrongfully dismissed can file a claim for either of the following:\nReinstatement to their former employment and payment of an amount equivalent to the wages that the employee would have earned, if the employee had not been dismissed.\nCompensation of an amount of wages to be determined by the tribunal.\nA full list of claims that can be brought to the ECT may be found in the\nFirst and Second Schedules of the ECA\n.\nTypes of Claims that Cannot be Brought to the ECT\nExamples of claims that cannot be brought to the ECT include the following:\nWorkmen’s compensation for injuries defined in the Workplace Safety and Health Act.\nEmployment transfer.\nPayment-related disputes for self-employed persons.\nFile a small claim\ninstead if you have a claim arising from a contract in which you have provided services involving your skill or labour.\nNon-payment of Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions.\nInform the\nCPF Board\nfor appropriate action to be taken.\nClaims involving restraint of trade clauses (e.g.\nnon-solicitation clauses\nand other\nnon-competition clauses\n)\nThese are more complicated claims and for such claims, you should file them in the Civil Courts.\nEmployees who are public servants, domestic workers and seafarers cannot bring their contractual salary-related claims to the ECT. The reason for this is because there are other avenues to resolve their claims. Public servants can resolve their disputes through the Public Service’s internal processes. Domestic workers can still resolve their disputes through Ministry of Manpower or their respective employment agencies. As for seafarers, they can resolve their disputes through the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) Act 2014.\nHowever, it is noted that public servants, domestic workers and seafarers can still bring limited statutory salary-related claims such as claims for employment assistance payments and maternity benefits to the ECT.\nDo also note that you are unable to file a claim against a party who resides outside of Singapore or has a registered office or place of business there.\nHow to File the Claim\nBefore filing for the claim, a mediation request must first be submitted at the TADM. If the mediation was successful, a settlement agreement is signed between both parties and the settlement agreement must be registered online on the\nCommunity Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS)\nwebsite within 4 weeks. However, if the mediation is unsuccessful, a claim referral certificate (CRC) will be issued. The claim may then be filed online on the\nCommunity Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS)\nwebsite within 4 weeks.\nThe costs of filing the claim are:\n$30 if you are claiming $10,000 or less\n$60 if your claim exceeds $10,000\nDo note that if you have a salary-related claim against your employer and you are currently employed by the employer, you are to file your claim within 1 year after the dispute has arisen. If you have left the employment of your employer, you are to file your claim within 6 months of your last day of work.\nFor wrongful dismissal claims, if you are a pregnant employee who has been wrongfully dismissed without being paid your maternity benefits, you are to file your claim within 2 months from the date of your confinement. For other wrongful dismissal claims, you are to file your claim within 1 month of your last day of work.\nAfter filing your claim, you will also need to bring it to the attention of the respondent. You are required to serve on the respondent documents relating to the claim. This can be done by hand (i.e. delivering the documents to the respondent yourself), registered post or other means, such as through fax or email.\nProceedings and Orders\nAfter filing your claim, a date and time will be scheduled for the ECT to hear your claim. You are required to present your own case during the proceedings before the tribunal.\nLawyers are not permitted to represent any party during ECT proceedings. In addition, ECT proceedings are conducted in private, so media personnel and members of the public are not allowed to be present.\nDo note that the ECT may order the parties to go for mediation at any stage of the proceedings. If a party fails to do so, they may be guilty of\ncontempt of court\nand liable to a fine of up to S$200,000 and/or a term of imprisonment up to 12 months.\nAfter hearing the dispute, for a salary-related claim, the ECT may make the following orders:\nRequiring one party to pay money to the other.\nDismissing the entire claim or any part of the claim.\nFor a wrongful dismissal claim, the following orders may be made:\nRequire an employer to reinstate the employee and pay him/her the loss of wages from the date of dismissal to the date of reinstatement.\nRequire an employer to pay compensation to the employee.\nDismiss the claim.\nRefer both parties for mediation.\nIn either case (salary-related or wrongful dismissal), the ECT may also require a party to pay costs to another party.\nThe ECT will consider the following when choosing the appropriate order(s) to make:\nThe nature of the claim – does it fall within the jurisdiction of the ECT or the categories specified in the ECA?\nThe monetary value of the claim – does the claim amount fall within the claim limits of the ECA?\nIs the claim substantiated by the supported documents?\nHave the parties made efforts to settle the claim beforehand?\nOnce the ECT makes an order, the order may be enforced in the same way as a District Court order. We have an article that covers the\nenforcement of court judgments in Singapore\nin more detail.\nIf you are dissatisfied with the order of the ECT, you may appeal to the General Division of the High Court but only if the District Court grants permission to appeal on a point of law. Alternatively, you may also appeal to the General Division of the High Court on the basis that the ECT had made orders for a matter that is outside the ECT’s jurisdiction.\nIn the meantime, the enforce of the ECT’s order is not stayed unless the District Court or the General Division of the High Court gives its approval for a stay of enforcement (previously known as a “stay of execution”).\nImplications of the ECT on Businesses and PMEs\nEmployers can now file contractual and statutory salary-related claims relating to salary in lieu of notice of termination to the ECT.\nPreviously, PMEs earning a basic monthly salary exceeding $4,500 could not bring their claims to the TADM. After the establishment of the ECT, all PMEs who are union members in non-unionised companies may file a claim. Rank-and-file union members in non-unionised companies may also file a claim.\nIf your claims falls outside the jurisdiction of the ECT, you can consult our\nemployment dispute lawyers\non your next course of action.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

In contrast, the Small Claims Tribunals primarily hear disputes between consumers and suppliers, and do not handle salary-related or wrongful dismissal claims, which fall within the jurisdiction of the ECT. If you intend to pursue a claim for non-payment of salary, wrongful dismissal, or other matters within the jurisdiction of the ECT as outlined below, this article explains the types of claims you may file, the filing process, and the implications for businesses and Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs).\nThis article explores:\nThe jurisdiction of the ECT;\nTypes of claims that can be brought to the ECT;\nTypes of claims that cannot be brought to the ECT;\nPowers of the ECT;\nImplications for businesses; and\nImplications for Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs).\nJurisdiction of the ECT\nThe ECT is established under the Employment Claims Act 2016 (ECA). According to the ECA, the ECT is empowered to hear all claims listed in the Second Schedule of the ECA pertaining to the Employment Act, the\nRetirement and Re-employment Act\n, and the Child Development Co-Savings Act.\nMaximum Limit of the Claim\nThe maximum limit of the claim cannot exceed $20,000 at the ECT. However, the maximum amount is increased to $30,000 if the employee attends the mediation session conducted by the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM), or if the dispute has undergone mediation assisted by the trade unions.\nIf your claim exceeds the maximum limit stated above and if you still wish for your case to be heard at the ECT, you must abandon the excess amount. For example, if your claim is $50,000 and the maximum applicable limit is $30,000, you must agree to abandon the excess amount of $20,000 for the ECT to hear your claims. The abandoned excess amount is not claimable in any tribunal or court.\nIf you do not wish to abandon the excess amount, you may wish to consider seeking legal advice from our employment lawyers to pursue your claim in the civil courts.\nTypes of Claims that Can be Brought to the ECT\nSalary-related claims\nThe ECT can hear both statutory and contractual salary-related claims. Statutory salary-related claims are claims such as unpaid salaries, overtime pay and\nmaternity benefits\n. These claims are backed by statutes, e.g. Employment Act, Retirement and Re-employment Act, or the Child Development Co-Savings Act.\nFor statutory salary-related claims, the ECT often hears claims such as:\nNon-payment or partial payment of salary\nNon-payment or partial payment for overtime work requested by an employer\nNon-payment or partial payment of salary for work on rest days\nUnauthorised salary deductions\nPublic holiday pay\nEntitlement to paid annual leave\nSalary in lieu of notice\nSick leave pay\nNon-payment of maternity benefit under Part III of the Child Development Co-Savings Act\nEmployment assistance payment under Part IV of the Retirement and Re-employment Act\nFor contractual salary-related claims, the ECT can hear the following types of claims:\nAllowance\nAnnual wage supplement\nBonus payment\nCommission\nDeduction from salary\nEmployment assistance payment\nIncentive payment\nMedical benefit\nOvertime payment\nPay for extra work\nPay for public holiday or paid leave\nPay for work on public holiday\nPay for work on rest day\nPayment in lieu of unconsumed leave\nReimbursement\nfor expenses incurred while carrying out official duties\nSalary\nSalary in lieu of notice of termination\nTermination benefit (including\nretrenchment benefit\nor retirement benefit)\nDo note that claims need to be mediated at TADM before they can be heard at the ECT.\nWrongful dismissal claims\nIf you are an employee dismissed without just cause or excuse, you may make a wrongful dismissal claim. The ECT also hears such claims from 1 April 2019 onwards. Previously, employees had to bring such claims to the Ministry of Manpower. More information on wrongful dismissal of claims may be found in the\ntripartite guidelines on wrongful dismissal\n.\nEmployees who have been wrongfully dismissed can file a claim for either of the following:\nReinstatement to their former employment and payment of an amount equivalent to the wages that the employee would have earned, if the employee had not been dismissed.\nCompensation of an amount of wages to be determined by the tribunal.\nA full list of claims that can be brought to the ECT may be found in the\nFirst and Second Schedules of the ECA\n.\nTypes of Claims that Cannot be Brought to the ECT\nExamples of claims that cannot be brought to the ECT include the following:\nWorkmen’s compensation for injuries defined in the Workplace Safety and Health Act.\nEmployment transfer.\nPayment-related disputes for self-employed persons.\nFile a small claim\ninstead if you have a claim arising from a contract in which you have provided services involving your skill or labour.\nNon-payment of Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions.\nInform the\nCPF Board\nfor appropriate action to be taken.\nClaims involving restraint of trade clauses (e.g.\nnon-solicitation clauses\nand other\nnon-competition clauses\n)\nThese are more complicated claims and for such claims, you should file them in the Civil Courts.\nEmployees who are public servants, domestic workers and seafarers cannot bring their contractual salary-related claims to the ECT. The reason for this is because there are other avenues to resolve their claims. Public servants can resolve their disputes through the Public Service’s internal processes. Domestic workers can still resolve their disputes through Ministry of Manpower or their respective employment agencies. As for seafarers, they can resolve their disputes through the Merchant Shipping (Maritime Labour Convention) Act 2014.\nHowever, it is noted that public servants, domestic workers and seafarers can still bring limited statutory salary-related claims such as claims for employment assistance payments and maternity benefits to the ECT.\nDo also note that you are unable to file a claim against a party who resides outside of Singapore or has a registered office or place of business there.\nHow to File the Claim\nBefore filing for the claim, a mediation request must first be submitted at the TADM. If the mediation was successful, a settlement agreement is signed between both parties and the settlement agreement must be registered online on the\nCommunity Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS)\nwebsite within 4 weeks. However, if the mediation is unsuccessful, a claim referral certificate (CRC) will be issued. The claim may then be filed online on the\nCommunity Justice and Tribunals System (CJTS)\nwebsite within 4 weeks.\nThe costs of filing the claim are:\n$30 if you are claiming $10,000 or less\n$60 if your claim exceeds $10,000\nDo note that if you have a salary-related claim against your employer and you are currently employed by the employer, you are to file your claim within 1 year after the dispute has arisen. If you have left the employment of your employer, you are to file your claim within 6 months of your last day of work.\nFor wrongful dismissal claims, if you are a pregnant employee who has been wrongfully dismissed without being paid your maternity benefits, you are to file your claim within 2 months from the date of your confinement. For other wrongful dismissal claims, you are to file your claim within 1 month of your last day of work.\nAfter filing your claim, you will also need to bring it to the attention of the respondent. You are required to serve on the respondent documents relating to the claim. This can be done by hand (i.e. delivering the documents to the respondent yourself), registered post or other means, such as through fax or email.\nProceedings and Orders\nAfter filing your claim, a date and time will be scheduled for the ECT to hear your claim. You are required to present your own case during the proceedings before the tribunal.\nLawyers are not permitted to represent any party during ECT proceedings. In addition, ECT proceedings are conducted in private, so media personnel and members of the public are not allowed to be present.\nDo note that the ECT may order the parties to go for mediation at any stage of the proceedings. If a party fails to do so, they may be guilty of\ncontempt of court\nand liable to a fine of up to S$200,000 and/or a term of imprisonment up to 12 months.\nAfter hearing the dispute, for a salary-related claim, the ECT may make the following orders:\nRequiring one party to pay money to the other.\nDismissing the entire claim or any part of the claim.\nFor a wrongful dismissal claim, the following orders may be made:\nRequire an employer to reinstate the employee and pay him/her the loss of wages from the date of dismissal to the date of reinstatement.\nRequire an employer to pay compensation to the employee.\nDismiss the claim.\nRefer both parties for mediation.\nIn either case (salary-related or wrongful dismissal), the ECT may also require a party to pay costs to another party.\nThe ECT will consider the following when choosing the appropriate order(s) to make:\nThe nature of the claim – does it fall within the jurisdiction of the ECT or the categories specified in the ECA?\nThe monetary value of the claim – does the claim amount fall within the claim limits of the ECA?\nIs the claim substantiated by the supported documents?\nHave the parties made efforts to settle the claim beforehand?\nOnce the ECT makes an order, the order may be enforced in the same way as a District Court order. We have an article that covers the\nenforcement of court judgments in Singapore\nin more detail.\nIf you are dissatisfied with the order of the ECT, you may appeal to the General Division of the High Court but only if the District Court grants permission to appeal on a point of law. Alternatively, you may also appeal to the General Division of the High Court on the basis that the ECT had made orders for a matter that is outside the ECT’s jurisdiction.\nIn the meantime, the enforce of the ECT’s order is not stayed unless the District Court or the General Division of the High Court gives its approval for a stay of enforcement (previously known as a “stay of execution”).\nImplications of the ECT on Businesses and PMEs\nEmployers can now file contractual and statutory salary-related claims relating to salary in lieu of notice of termination to the ECT.\nPreviously, PMEs earning a basic monthly salary exceeding $4,500 could not bring their claims to the TADM. After the establishment of the ECT, all PMEs who are union members in non-unionised companies may file a claim. Rank-and-file union members in non-unionised companies may also file a claim.\nIf your claims falls outside the jurisdiction of the ECT, you can consult our\nemployment dispute lawyers\non your next course of action.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

This is except for if you have contracted silicosis or asbestosis, where the time-frame would be within 3 years after the date you ceased employment.\nIf you are working outside of Singapore, you are also eligible to claim for an occupational disease provided that you are:\nA Singapore resident;\nEmployed by an employer in Singapore; and\nRequired in the course of the employment to work outside Singapore\nThe following persons however cannot make a claim for an occupational disease:\nIndependent contractors (e.g. freelancers)\nDomestic workers\nUniformed personnel of the Singapore government (e.g. Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Singapore Police Force)\nUnder Which Situations am I Allowed to Claim Compensation?\nYou can claim compensation for an occupational disease if\nthe type of occupational disease contracted is a result of the nature of your occupation\n.\nThis is provided for in the Second Schedule of the WICA where the first column describes the type of occupational diseases and the second column states the nature of occupations, which involves being exposed to a particular chemical or biological agent.\nFor example, if the occupational disease you’ve contracted is “byssinosis” (as stated in the first column) and the cause of which is your nature of occupation which involves exposure to raw cotton fibre (as stated in the second column), then you can claim compensation for that occupational disease.\nNevertheless, you can still claim compensation for an occupational disease which is not listed under the WICA as long as you show that:\nThe disease suffered was directly caused by being exposed to a chemical or biological agent;\nThe disease had arisen out of your employment or in the course of your employment; and\nYou suffered incapacity or\ndeath\nas a result of the disease contracted. (In the event of death, your dependants will be able to obtain the compensation instead.)\nWhen am I Not Allowed to Claim Compensation for an Occupational Disease?\nThere will be no compensation if:\nYou suffered incapacity after you ceased employment\nand\nafter the time limit stated in the third column of the Second Schedule of the WICA for your occupational disease suffered; or\nThe occupational disease you suffered is not stated under the WICA or WSHA and you suffered incapacity more than 1 year after you ceased being exposed to the biological and chemical agent.\nWhat Can I Claim and How Much Can I claim?\nUnder the\nWICA\n, you may claim for the following types of compensation:\nLost earnings:\nthis includes lost earnings for working days for which you were issued medical leave due to an occupational disease;\nMedical expenses: this includes your hospital bills, medication and other charges arising from the occupational disease suffered; and\nLump-sum compensation\n: this compensation only applies if you have suffered permanent incapacity or death.\nFor further details, please refer to our other article on the\ntypes of work injury claims and claim amounts\n.\nHow Do I Claim Compensation for an Occupational Disease?\nIf you have contracted an occupational disease (whether listed under WICA or WSHA), you can either make a claim under the WICA, or through the courts under a common law civil claim.\nBetween these two methods, making a claim under the WICA may be more preferable as it is generally a faster and more affordable option, where compensation is generally payable once certain conditions are met and procedures have been complied with.\nOn the other hand, making a common law civil claim may allow you to claim for higher compensation amounts, but you will need to prove that you are entitled to such higher compensation. If your common law civil claim fails, you will not be able to make a subsequent claim under WICA in respect of the same occupational disease.\nYou may wish to\nconsult a personal injury lawyer\non which method of claiming for an occupational disease would be more appropriate for your situation.\nThe process of claiming compensation for an occupational disease under the WICA is as follows:\n1. Seek medical treatment and inform your employer immediately\nReport the accident to your employer as soon as possible. A claim is made once your employer is notified of the accident.\n2. Your employer or doctor will make an incident report to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)\nFor occupational diseases under either WICA or WSHA, your employer will make an incident report to MOM within 10 days of receiving a written diagnosis.\nIf you have contracted some other occupational disease not covered under either WICA or WSHA, your employer is required to submit an incident report to MOM within 10 days of the accident if it is fatal, or within 10 days of the employer’s first awareness of a non-fatal accident.\nYour doctor, on the other hand, will also need to make an incident report if you have contracted an occupational disease under the WSHA (but not the WICA), within 10 days of the diagnosis and inform your employer of the diagnosis in writing.\nIn making a diagnosis, a doctor may refer you to an occupational health clinic for further investigation if they are unsure if the disease is work-related. Once an incident report is made, claims processing will automatically begin.\n3. Decide if you wish to claim under the WICA\nYou will then have to decide whether you wish to claim for your occupational disease under the WICA.\nIf you wish to make a claim,\nyour designated insurer will mail you a claims processing form requesting for more details on the accident and your average monthly earnings. Fill in the claims processing form and submit a scanned copy of it to the designated insurer by email or mail to the\ndesignated insurer’s address\n.\nIf you don’t wish to make a WICA claim and would like to file a civil suit instead\n, you will need to get a withdrawal form from your designated insurer and submit it back to them within 2 weeks of MOM being notified of the situation.\n4. Attend a medical assessment if you wish to claim\nIf you wish to claim, you will need to attend a medical assessment to assess the extent of your incapacity. You must attend all medical appointments for the medical assessment. Otherwise, your claim may be suspended.\nYou may seek treatment from any hospital or medical institution. However, your company may request for you to be treated or assessed by company-approved hospitals or medical institutions.\n5. Receive Notice of Assessment (NOA) and compensation\nWhen your designated insurer receives the hospital’s medical report, they will calculate the compensation amount. The insurer will then issue a notice of computation (NOC) that includes the medical report and an objection form. This notice will inform both you and your employer of the compensation payable.\nIf no one objects to the NOA, your employer or your employer’s insurer is required to issue your compensation cheque within 21 days from the date of service of the NOA.\nHowever, if any party objects to the computation, they must complete and submit the objection form as instructed in the NOC to MOM within 14 days from the date of service of the NOA.\nYour compensation may be reassessed any time within 3 years after the date of service of your NOA, if the condition of your incapacity has worsened and the previous compensation was inadequate.\nDo I Need a Lawyer to Claim Compensation for an Occupational Disease?\nYou are able to file a WICA claim on your own. However, an experienced lawyer will be able to assess your particular situation and advise you whether you should make a claim under the WICA or the common law. The lawyer can assist you with filing the WICA claim, if you so wish.\nAlternatively, if you intend to make a claim under the common law, the lawyer can help to prove to the court that your employer was negligent and caused you to suffer the occupational disease, which may increase the chances of your claim succeeding and you obtaining a larger compensation amount.\nFeel free to\nget in touch with our personal injury lawyers\nfor further assistance.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Fill in the claims processing form and submit a scanned copy of it to the designated insurer by email or mail to the\ndesignated insurer’s address\n.\nIf you don’t wish to make a WICA claim and would like to file a civil suit instead\n, you will need to get a withdrawal form from your designated insurer and submit it back to them within 2 weeks of MOM being notified of the situation.\n4. Attend a medical assessment if you wish to claim\nIf you wish to claim, you will need to attend a medical assessment to assess the extent of your incapacity. You must attend all medical appointments for the medical assessment. Otherwise, your claim may be suspended.\nYou may seek treatment from any hospital or medical institution. However, your company may request for you to be treated or assessed by company-approved hospitals or medical institutions.\n5. Receive Notice of Assessment (NOA) and compensation\nWhen your designated insurer receives the hospital’s medical report, they will calculate the compensation amount. The insurer will then issue a notice of computation (NOC) that includes the medical report and an objection form. This notice will inform both you and your employer of the compensation payable.\nIf no one objects to the NOA, your employer or your employer’s insurer is required to issue your compensation cheque within 21 days from the date of service of the NOA.\nHowever, if any party objects to the computation, they must complete and submit the objection form as instructed in the NOC to MOM within 14 days from the date of service of the NOA.\nYour compensation may be reassessed any time within 3 years after the date of service of your NOA, if the condition of your incapacity has worsened and the previous compensation was inadequate.\nDo I Need a Lawyer to Claim Compensation for an Occupational Disease?\nYou are able to file a WICA claim on your own. However, an experienced lawyer will be able to assess your particular situation and advise you whether you should make a claim under the WICA or the common law. The lawyer can assist you with filing the WICA claim, if you so wish.\nAlternatively, if you intend to make a claim under the common law, the lawyer can help to prove to the court that your employer was negligent and caused you to suffer the occupational disease, which may increase the chances of your claim succeeding and you obtaining a larger compensation amount.\nFeel free to\nget in touch with our personal injury lawyers\nfor further assistance.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

This makes our choice of employees a crucial one. However, this must not lead to you engaging in discriminatory practices during the recruitment process.\nThis article will explain what discriminatory hiring is and the penalties employers may face for engaging in discriminatory hiring practices in Singapore.\nWhat is Discriminatory Hiring?\nDiscriminatory hiring refers to the recruitment of employees based on criteria other than their ability to perform the job. This would include age, race, gender, religion, nationality or marital status.\nAs an employer, you should note that discriminatory practices can happen at any point during the recruitment process. For example:\nWhen advertising the job vacancy\n: An advertisement stating a “Chinese-speaking environment” can be considered discriminatory.\nDuring the job application\n: A job application form requiring information on the candidate’s age may be discriminatory.\nAt the interview\n: Asking a candidate whether she intends to have a child during an interview can be discriminatory.\nIs discriminatory hiring considered workplace discrimination?\nDiscriminatory hiring is one aspect of workplace discrimination. Workplace discrimination also encompasses other areas such as matters of salary, promotion, training and posting.\nSingapore recognises all these different aspects of workplace discrimination in its\nFair Consideration Framework (FCF)\n.\nThe FCF was introduced in 2014 and requires employers to consider all job applicants fairly. It encourages employers to adopt a merit-based approach to recruitment, salary, promotion, training and posting.\nThe FCF was updated in 2020 to impose stiffer penalties on employers who engage in discriminatory hiring practices.\nThe government has plans to\npass further legislation related to hiring and workplace discrimination in the second half of 2024.\nHow does MOM Identify Employers Who Have Engaged in Discriminatory Hiring Practices?\nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) administers the FCF with the help of the\nTripartite Alliance for Fair & Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP)\n. MOM has a few ways to identify employers that have engaged in discriminatory hiring practices. These include:\nComplaints from the public\n: A job applicant can\nfile a complaint with TAFEP\n. Upon receiving a complaint, TAFEP will contact the employer and encourage them to adopt fairer employment practices. If the errant employer fails to do so or ignores TAFEP, the case would then be referred to MOM.\nData analytics\n: MOM will compare the employment data of a particular company with industry peers. Data which is then identified as significantly different from industry peers, pointing at discriminatory hiring,  will be flagged. For example, hiring more foreigners than their peers could indicate that such employers have not considered locals fairly for the job, proving discriminatory hiring.\nWhat are the Penalties for Discriminatory Hiring?\nMOM takes a strong stance against discriminatory hiring practices and will investigate any allegations. If the allegations are true, MOM can take action against them.\nPlacing errant employers on an FCF Watchlist\nAs its first course of action, MOM will proactively place employers who have received complaints of discriminatory practices or whose hiring practices differ from their peers on the FCF Watchlist. Employers placed on the FCF Watchlist have up to 6 months to improve their human resource practices. Those that have shown improvement will be removed from the Watchlist. Otherwise, MOM may take further action against them (see below).\nPreventing new work pass applications and renewals\nFollowing what was mentioned above, MOM can then prevent errant employers from applying for work passes for new employees and work pass renewals for existing ones as a further cause of action, if needed. The debarment period can last from 12 months to 24 months, depending on the severity of the case. The 24-month debarment period is typically reserved for the most serious cases.\nCharging an errant employer under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA)\nOne of the gripes of locals is that foreign companies incentivised to be based in Singapore discriminate against locals in the process of recruitment. As such, employers are required to declare in the work pass applications of foreign employees that they had considered local candidates for the job. If an employer makes this declaration without actually fairly considering local candidates, it may be charged with making a false statement under the EFMA. This offence carries a maximum fine of S$20,000 and/or a jail term of up to 2 years.\nIn January 2020,\nlogistics company Ti2 Logistics was charged with making a false statement\nin a work pass application under the updated FCF. This was after it had declared that it had considered locals for a business development position when it had not.\nWhat are Some Fair Hiring Practices Employers Must Follow in Singapore?\nThe FCF covers fair hiring practices for the 3 aspects of recruitment mentioned earlier:\nJob advertisements\nJob applications\nJob interviews\nJob\nadvertisements\nEmployers intending to submit an Employment Pass application must first advertise the vacancy at the\nMyCareersFuture.sg jobs portal\nmaintained by Workforce Singapore. MyCareersFuture.sg helps match employers with local job seekers. This allows locals to be considered fairly for these vacancies.\nHowever, this requirement is waived if:\nAn employer with less than 10 employees;\nThe vacancy has a salary of S$22,500 or higher;\nThe vacancy is not more than 1 month; or\nThe vacancy is to be filled by a transferee from within the same corporation.\nEmployers who advertise on MyCareersFuture.sg must keep the advertisement up for at least 14 days. If there are any changes to the details during this period, a new advertisement should be posted and must remain on MyCareersFuture.sg for another 14 days from the date of the latest change to the advertisement.\nFurther, the selection criteria in the advertisement must relate to the qualification, skills, knowledge or experience of the candidate. Advertisements that contain age, gender, race, religion, nationality, or marital status requirements should be avoided.\nHowever, certain jobs may have specific gender, religious or language requirements. For example, a female model for women’s clothes, a Hindu priest to perform Hindu rites, or a language teacher. In such cases, the reasons for that criteria must be clearly stated to avoid any perception of\ndiscrimination.\nJob application forms\nJob application forms should not require applicants to provide information that is not relevant to the job. This may include information on the applicant’s age, gender, race, religion, marital status, disability, national service liability or mental health, or requests for the applicant’s photograph.\nThe only information required to assess the applicant’s suitability, such as skills, experience, or qualifications, should be asked. This ensures that applicants are assessed only on their\nmerits.\nJob interview/tests\nSimilarly, a fair job interview focuses on merit-based and non-discriminatory questions. Employers should only ask questions relevant to the job. If there is a need to ask a question that can be considered discriminatory, the employer should explain the reasons for those questions to the candidate.\nIf there are tests incorporated into the interview process, the test questions should be related to the job. Further, the questions should be reviewed regularly to make sure that they remain relevant.\n—\nThe FCF does not only protect employees from discrimination. Adopting its principles will also put employers in good stead. It will widen the pool of candidates available and increase the chance of finding the ideal fit for the position.\nAlso, it will help to retain valued employees that can help grow your business. However, it is still possible for an employer to engage in discriminatory hiring practices without knowing it.\nIf you are an employer wondering whether your advertisement is discriminatory, or one that has been charged under the EFMA and unsure what to do next, do not hesitate to\nconsult one of our employment disputes lawyers\nfor help.\nHow to Hire Remote Employees for Your Singapore Company\nLetter of Consent in Singapore: Eligibility and How to Apply\nEmployment for the Disabled in Singapore: Laws and Schemes\nA Quick Guide to Singapore’s Employment Law\nHow to Hire Employees in Singapore: Step-by-Step Guide\nWhat is the Minimum Legal Age for Working in Singapore?\nHow to Hire Foreign Workers in Singapore\nWork From Home Policy: Things to Consider & How to Write One\nPreparing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) in Singapore\nGuide to Re-Employment and Retirement in Singapore\nFAQs on Singapore’s New Laws for Platform Workers\nEx Gratia Payments: What are They & When do Employers Pay Them?\nWhat is the Difference Between Wages, Salaries and Remuneration?\nSick Leave Entitlements for Employees in Singapore\nA Guide to Company Leave Entitlements in Singapore\nCPF-Payable Contributions in Singapore: A Guide for Employers\nProgressive Wage Model: Minimum Wage Laws in Singapore\nWork-Life Balance Laws and Policies in Singapore: A Guide\nMental Health Policies for Singapore Workplaces (Tripartite Advisory)\nAn Employer’s Guide to Reimbursement of Expenses and Claims\nCode of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' WSH Duties: What Employers Should Know\nHow to Issue Payslips to Your Employees in Singapore\nCan Muslims Legally Wear the Tudung at Work in Singapore?\nThe Expecting Father's Guide to Paternity Leave in Singapore\nGuide to Maternity Leave for Expecting Mothers in Singapore\nWho is Covered Under the Singapore Employment Act?\nEmployment Rights of Interns and Trainees in Singapore\nEmployee Salary: Calculations, Deductions, Unpaid Salary & More\nCPF Contribution of Employees and Employers, Rates & More\nCan Your Boss Ask You to Work on a Public Holiday in Singapore?\nHow to Write a Fair and Accurate Employee Reference Letter\nWhat is the employer's golden rule in the prevention of workplace injuries?\nEvery Parent’s Guide to Childcare Leave in Singapore\nDeath of an Employee in Singapore: What Should Employers Do?\nAre Codes of Conduct Legally Binding in Singapore?\nMorality Clauses in Contracts: What is Considered a Breach?\nEmployment Bond: What is It & Can It be Enforced in Singapore?\nContracts OF Service vs Contracts FOR Service in Singapore: What’s the Difference?\nIs Your Non-Compete Clause Enforceable in Singapore?\nWhat are Non-Solicitation Clauses?

Even if you’re unsure whether a lawyer is necessary, a short consultation can help clarify your concerns to help you avoid mistakes that might harm your case or business.\nHow can an employment lawyer help me?\nEmployment lawyers can provide crucial support to both employees and employers in a variety of situations.\nFor employees\nAs an employee, an employment lawyer can assist you in the following non-exhaustive matters:\nWrongful Dismissal\n: If you believe you have been unfairly terminated, an employment lawyer can assess your case, advise you on your legal rights and help you seek remedies such as compensation or reinstatement. For example, if an employee is being terminated without notice after filing a harassment complaint, an employment lawyer can assist them to file a claim with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management, or help to negotiate a settlement with the employer.\nDiscrimination or Harassment at Work\n: A lawyer can assist in filing formal complaints or claims if you have experienced unfair treatment based on race, gender, age, or other protected grounds.\nSalary or Contract Disputes\n: If your employer has withheld pay or breached your contract terms, a lawyer can help you recover what you are owed and represent you in negotiation or dispute resolution proceedings.\nReviewing Employment Contracts\n: Before starting a new job, you may want a lawyer to review your employment contract for unfavourable terms or ambiguous clauses that may prejudice your position in the company or even future employment prospects. For example, if you have been asked to sign a non-compete clause, an employment lawyer can evaluate its enforceability and explain how it may affect your future job opportunities.\nFor employers\nAs an employer, you can benefit from legal advice when drafting employment contracts, terminating staff, responding to employee claims, or implementing workplace policies. A lawyer ensures your actions are legally sound and compliant with Singapore’s employment laws, which helps reduce the risk of disputes or penalties. In short, consulting a lawyer proactively can save you significant time, cost, and reputational damage later on. Employment lawyers can assist employers in matters such as:\nDrafting Employment Contracts\n: A lawyer can draft or review employment agreements to ensure clarity, enforceability, and compliance with Singapore law. For example, start-ups often require a lawyer to ensure business compliance with labour laws, and to create standard employment contracts with clear probation, termination, and confidentiality clauses with adequate protection to avoid future disputes.\nEmployee Misconduct or Termination\n: If you need to discipline or terminate an employee, a lawyer can advise you on proper procedures to reduce legal risk. For example, if an employer intends to dismiss an employee for repeated lateness, engaging an employment lawyer will ensure the termination or dismissal process is compliant with labour laws. Your lawyer will guide you through the proper due process and documentation to protect the company from any potential wrongful dismissal claim.\nResponding to Employee Claims\n: If an employee lodges a complaint or files a claim (e.g., with the Ministry of Manpower or Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management), a lawyer should be engaged to represent your company and advise on the best course of action.\nImplementing Workplace Policies\n: A lawyer can help you draft policies on harassment, leave entitlements and data protection, ensuring they are legally sound and enforceable.\nHow do I choose a good employment lawyer for my matter?\nWhen selecting an employment lawyer, you should consider the following factors:\nExperience and Specialisation\n: Choose a lawyer who specialises in employment law and has handled cases similar to yours.\nComplexity of your case\n: When choosing between a small or large law firm, consider how complex your case is. Larger firms are better suited for complex, multi-jurisdictional matters involving numerous employees, while smaller firms or solo practitioners are often sufficient for simpler issues like contract drafting or hiring foreign workers.\nClient Reviews and Reputation\n: Look at testimonials or feedback from past clients to assess the lawyers’ professionalism and reliability. Reviews and referrals from trusted peers who have previously engaged an employment lawyer are also good indicators of the service you might expect.\nCommunication Style\n: A good lawyer should be able to explain complex legal terms in plain English and be contactable and responsive in keeping you informed at every step.\nFor further information, you may refer to our\nguide on how to choose an employment lawyer well-suited to your needs\n.\nWhat is the cost of hiring an employment lawyer?\nLegal fees for employment lawyers in Singapore can vary widely depending on the complexity of your case and the seniority or experience of the lawyer. Many employment lawyers offer different fee arrangements, such as hourly rates, fixed fees for specific services like drafting employment contracts or handling specific types of disputes, depending on the nature of the case.\nTypically, the charges for simple matters such as drafting and reviewing contracts range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the scope. The legal fees for more complex matters requiring extensive time and research or legal representation in court disputes will be more expensive. If the matter proceeds to court, there may also be additional disbursements like court filing fees or expert witness fees.\nMany lawyers offer free or low-cost initial consultations, so it is worth reaching out to discuss your case to obtain a quote and understand the lawyer’s fee structure upfront.\n—\nWhether you’re an employer or employee, employment-related matters can often be complex and stressful. Choosing the right employment lawyer based on your specific legal needs is crucial to navigating these challenges effectively. If you’re dealing with workplace disputes, need help interpreting contracts, or want to ensure legal compliance with employment laws and guidelines, the right lawyer can protect your rights, minimise risks, and guide you through the legal process with confidence.\nYou may wish to engage one of the top-rated lawyers listed above or reach out to other employment lawyers through our\nFind a Lawyer service here\n.\nNo Win No Fee: Contingency Fee Lawyers in Singapore\nWhat Happens If I Don’t Pay My Legal Fees?\nLawyer Fees in Singapore\nHow Do Lawyers Charge for Civil Litigation in Singapore?\nWhat are the Fees for Hiring a Criminal Lawyer in Singapore?\nHere's Why Lawyers Can't Just State Their Fees Up Front\nCan You Take a Loan for Legal Fees?

Even if you’re unsure whether a lawyer is necessary, a short consultation can help clarify your concerns to help you avoid mistakes that might harm your case or business.\nHow can an employment lawyer help me?\nEmployment lawyers can provide crucial support to both employees and employers in a variety of situations.\nFor employees\nAs an employee, an employment lawyer can assist you in the following non-exhaustive matters:\nWrongful Dismissal\n: If you believe you have been unfairly terminated, an employment lawyer can assess your case, advise you on your legal rights and help you seek remedies such as compensation or reinstatement. For example, if an employee is being terminated without notice after filing a harassment complaint, an employment lawyer can assist them to file a claim with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management, or help to negotiate a settlement with the employer.\nDiscrimination or Harassment at Work\n: A lawyer can assist in filing formal complaints or claims if you have experienced unfair treatment based on race, gender, age, or other protected grounds.\nSalary or Contract Disputes\n: If your employer has withheld pay or breached your contract terms, a lawyer can help you recover what you are owed and represent you in negotiation or dispute resolution proceedings.\nReviewing Employment Contracts\n: Before starting a new job, you may want a lawyer to review your employment contract for unfavourable terms or ambiguous clauses that may prejudice your position in the company or even future employment prospects. For example, if you have been asked to sign a non-compete clause, an employment lawyer can evaluate its enforceability and explain how it may affect your future job opportunities.\nFor employers\nAs an employer, you can benefit from legal advice when drafting employment contracts, terminating staff, responding to employee claims, or implementing workplace policies. A lawyer ensures your actions are legally sound and compliant with Singapore’s employment laws, which helps reduce the risk of disputes or penalties. In short, consulting a lawyer proactively can save you significant time, cost, and reputational damage later on. Employment lawyers can assist employers in matters such as:\nDrafting Employment Contracts\n: A lawyer can draft or review employment agreements to ensure clarity, enforceability, and compliance with Singapore law. For example, start-ups often require a lawyer to ensure business compliance with labour laws, and to create standard employment contracts with clear probation, termination, and confidentiality clauses with adequate protection to avoid future disputes.\nEmployee Misconduct or Termination\n: If you need to discipline or terminate an employee, a lawyer can advise you on proper procedures to reduce legal risk. For example, if an employer intends to dismiss an employee for repeated lateness, engaging an employment lawyer will ensure the termination or dismissal process is compliant with labour laws. Your lawyer will guide you through the proper due process and documentation to protect the company from any potential wrongful dismissal claim.\nResponding to Employee Claims\n: If an employee lodges a complaint or files a claim (e.g., with the Ministry of Manpower or Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management), a lawyer should be engaged to represent your company and advise on the best course of action.\nImplementing Workplace Policies\n: A lawyer can help you draft policies on harassment, leave entitlements and data protection, ensuring they are legally sound and enforceable.\nHow do I choose a good employment lawyer for my matter?\nWhen selecting an employment lawyer, you should consider the following factors:\nExperience and Specialisation\n: Choose a lawyer who specialises in employment law and has handled cases similar to yours.\nComplexity of your case\n: When choosing between a small or large law firm, consider how complex your case is. Larger firms are better suited for complex, multi-jurisdictional matters involving numerous employees, while smaller firms or solo practitioners are often sufficient for simpler issues like contract drafting or hiring foreign workers.\nClient Reviews and Reputation\n: Look at testimonials or feedback from past clients to assess the lawyers’ professionalism and reliability. Reviews and referrals from trusted peers who have previously engaged an employment lawyer are also good indicators of the service you might expect.\nCommunication Style\n: A good lawyer should be able to explain complex legal terms in plain English and be contactable and responsive in keeping you informed at every step.\nFor further information, you may refer to our\nguide on how to choose an employment lawyer well-suited to your needs\n.\nWhat is the cost of hiring an employment lawyer?\nLegal fees for employment lawyers in Singapore can vary widely depending on the complexity of your case and the seniority or experience of the lawyer. Many employment lawyers offer different fee arrangements, such as hourly rates, fixed fees for specific services like drafting employment contracts or handling specific types of disputes, depending on the nature of the case.\nTypically, the charges for simple matters such as drafting and reviewing contracts range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the scope. The legal fees for more complex matters requiring extensive time and research or legal representation in court disputes will be more expensive. If the matter proceeds to court, there may also be additional disbursements like court filing fees or expert witness fees.\nMany lawyers offer free or low-cost initial consultations, so it is worth reaching out to discuss your case to obtain a quote and understand the lawyer’s fee structure upfront.\n—\nWhether you’re an employer or employee, employment-related matters can often be complex and stressful. Choosing the right employment lawyer based on your specific legal needs is crucial to navigating these challenges effectively. If you’re dealing with workplace disputes, need help interpreting contracts, or want to ensure legal compliance with employment laws and guidelines, the right lawyer can protect your rights, minimise risks, and guide you through the legal process with confidence.\nYou may wish to engage one of the top-rated lawyers listed above or reach out to other employment lawyers through our\nFind a Lawyer service here\n.\nNo Win No Fee: Contingency Fee Lawyers in Singapore\nWhat Happens If I Don’t Pay My Legal Fees?\nLawyer Fees in Singapore\nHow Do Lawyers Charge for Civil Litigation in Singapore?\nWhat are the Fees for Hiring a Criminal Lawyer in Singapore?\nHere's Why Lawyers Can't Just State Their Fees Up Front\nCan You Take a Loan for Legal Fees?
